Holden Hardcastle's Design Portfolio
— Aspiring to create beautiful, exciting, and positive experiences by working with inspired and driven people —
Throughout my professional career, I have collaborated with teams at Apple, Amazon, Sony, HBO, and Lucasfilm. I have worked with authors, editors, and artists to push creative boundaries. I thrive on generously sharing ideas, resources, and information with my peers. Whether it's bringing people together through an application or developing a dynamic brand to change the world, I believe that inspired teams yield inspirational results.
