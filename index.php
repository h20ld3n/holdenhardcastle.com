            <h3>AEE Website and Process Redesign</h3>
            <p>The updated design improves on the previously bandwidth and process intensive version. The updating process was streamline by using an existing infastructure and content management systems, built on Bootstrap 2.0.4. The low cost solution not only free'd up the developers to focus on other projects, but enabled marketers and project owners to easily create and update pages within brand guidlines.</p>
