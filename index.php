          				<p>In order to create a prosperous future, Advanced Energy Economy (AEE) envisions a world that runs on secure, clean, and affordable energy. AEE engages member companies, and recruits partners through education, and encourages participation in energy policy changing initiatives.</p>
         				<p>Policy and legislation changes quickly. In order to keep up emerging energy regulations, the AEE website needed to be redesigned and migrated to a content management system (CMS). By implementing a CMS, projects leads would able to make timely content updates.</p> 
          				<p>Working with the communications, marketing and development teams we identified and implemented specific improvements on both the front and backend.</p>
          				<p>By building templates on a flexible and responsive Bootstrap foundation, we made content updates more efficient and streamlined the look and feel of the site.</p>

To engage member companies the reports are available for download, distributed at events, and presented at congressional hearings.</p>
          				<p>By collaborating with the communications team and project leads we implemented the newly established brand guidelines to define and apply consistent hierarchy and visual style to reports. Covers communicate the subject of the complex reports in a single image.</p>

						<p>In order to connect owners and users of the TRX Suspension Trainer to gyms, trainers, and each other, Fitness Anywhere was looking to move away from producing single workouts distributed on DVDs. The application, online community, and sport specific workout pages were all designed to encourage users to find places and people to workout out with.</p>
            			<p>The internal team of production artists, designers, developers, marketing leads, and program directors all contributed to the updated user experience. Wireframes, layouts, updated look and feel, and the style guide that was born out of the extensive retooling, were created through a team effort to bring owners of the TRX together.</p>
            			<p>The new experience and application was launched in partnership with Drew Brees, the 2010 Super Bowl MVP and Quarterback for the NFL's New Orleans Saints, encouraging users with similar fitness goals to get out from in front of the television and connect with other people in the community.</p>
