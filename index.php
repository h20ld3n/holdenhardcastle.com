          <h3>AEE Website and Process Redesign</h3>
          <p>In order to create a prosperous future, Advanced Energy Economy (AEE) envisions a world that runs on secure, clean, and affordable energy. AEE engages member companies, and recruits partners through education, and encourages participation in energy policy changing initiatives.</p>
         <p>Policy and legislation changes quickly. In order to keep up emerging energy regulations, the AEE website needed to be redesigned and migrated to a content management system (CMS). By implementing a CMS, projects leads would able to make timely content updates.</p> 
          <p>Working with the communications, marketing and development teams we identified and implemented specific improvements on both the front and backend.</p>
          <p>By building templates on a flexible and responsive Bootstrap foundation, we made content updates more efficient and streamlined the look and feel of the site.</p>

          <p>The educational reports focus on the technical, economic, social, and political issues surrounding advanced energy, and how to improve the energy sector. To engage member companies the reports are available for download, distributed at events, and presented at congressional hearings.</p>
          <p>By collaborating with the communications team and project leads we implemented the newly established brand guidelines to define and apply consistent hierarchy and visual style to reports. Covers, the subject of much debate among the various teams, communicate the subject of the complex reports in a single image.</p> 
          <p>Using a grid system and dynamically linking text to design files, the annual and semi-annual reports are effortlessly designed and produced. The powerful imagery and iconography create a visual message that accelerates the transition to an advanced energy economy.</p>
          <p>The California Advanced Energy Emplyment Survey report won a 2016 American Graphic Design Award.</p>

          <p>High profile titles, authors, subject matter, and content require meeting to set expectations, and to learn or revisit the intent of the original material.

			<p>In order to connect owners, and users of the TRX Suspension Trainer to gyms, trainers, and each other, Fitness Anywhere was looking to move away from producing single workouts distributed on DVDs. The application, online community, and sport specific workout landing pages were all designed to encourage users to find other places and people to workout out with.</p>
            <p>The internal team of production artists, designers, developers, marketing leads, and program directors all contributed to wireframes, layouts, look and feel, and the eventual style guide that was born out of the extensive retooling of the site.</p>
            <p>Partnering with Drew Brees, the Quarterback for the NFL's New Orleans Saints and 2010 Super Bowl MVP, the application, and community launch, website update were part of a fitness campaign encouraging users of similar interest, and fitness goals to get out from in front of the television, and connect with other people in the community.</p>
