The device agnostic content would be fine-tuned by embedding fonts, altering images, and adding other design elements.</p>
          				<p>High profile titles, authors, subject matter, and content required careful management and setting of expectations. The titles were revisited to discuss the original intentions of the authors and content.</p>

          				<h3>Website, Application, and Experience Design</h3>
						<p>In order to connect owners and users of the TRX Suspension Trainer to gyms, trainers, and each other, Fitness Anywhere was looking to move away from producing single workouts distributed on DVDs. The application, online community, and sport specific workout pages were all designed to encourage users to find places and people to workout with.</p>
            			<p>The internal team of production artists, designers, developers, marketing leads, and program directors all contributed to the updated user experience. Wireframes, layouts, updated look and feel, and the style guide that was born out of the extensive retooling, were created through a team effort to bring owners of the TRX together.</p>
            			<p>The new experience and application was launched in partnership with Drew Brees, the 2010 Super Bowl MVP and Quarterback for the NFL's New Orleans Saints, encouraging users with similar fitness goals to get out from in front of the television and connect with other people in the community.</p>
