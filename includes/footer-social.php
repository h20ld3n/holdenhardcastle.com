                        	<h3>About</h3>
                 			Throughout my professional career I have collaborated with teams at Apple, Amazon, Sony, HBO, and Lucasfilm. I've worked with authors, editors, and artists to push creative boundaries. I thrive on generously sharing ideas, resources, and information with my peers. Whether it's bringing people together through an application or developing a dynamic brand to change the world, I believe that inspired teams yield inspirational results.

                                    <li><i>Freakin hilarious. The opening is really kinetic. The full-on improv of this whole project is so charming. Dialogue is so funny—Candy croutons...America, the sweetest country to work for...I appreciate that you're reinvesting in yourselves, but I can't afford to have superheroes that are a work-in-progress" some of the best lines in Film Sprint history. Loved the county manager's lines, concept, and role—exceptionally meta. Provides structure and greatly helps clarify the story arc. Great montage!! This is cut well and has great pacing...the spinning newspaper—so tropey. It's fun, and I'm sucked in.</i></li>

                                    <li><i>Loved the concept, locations, lighting, graphics, music choices, seamless editing, and the constant feed of the main character's life. Technically impressive. The on-screen texts and graphics are awesome—equally valuable and draining on the main character's time. OMG! Two Holdens?? THE DOUBLE DREAM!! The horror of having to spend your day by yourself—the commentary on quarantine life. The way we see what he chooses to respond to vs. what he doesn't. Throwing a baseball to yourself and pan to yourself missing catching it? The acting is so freaking impressive. "You never think about what's right in front of you...this is so impactful. I love this. It's awesome.</i></li>

                                    <li><i>Loved the character and world-building and awesome touches of humor. The writing is sharp—an outstanding achievement in the field of stream of consciousness computer jargon. I couldn't turn away!!!!! Love the production value-added with the graphics—great use of screen capture and the Hitchcock zoom! WOOOW incredible art design. Sound design is not to be slept on. The film noir choices: starting with the credits, classic noir vibes, and the sparing use of color, were impactful. Good stuff!! Super creative. </i></li>

Great, creative use of the space...Loved the world-building...Kudos for making something so watchable...The subject matter was so real, and it really struck a nerve. I loved the montage break from the tension...I really liked this...the shooting / cutting really gave a lot of tension...The video/audio distortion was really well done...this was solid."</i></li>
