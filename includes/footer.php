                        	<h3>About</h3>
                 			Throughout my professional career I have collaborated with teams at Apple, Amazon, Sony, HBO, and Lucasfilm. I've worked with authors, editors, and artists to push creative boundaries. I thrive on generously sharing ideas, resources, and information with my peers. Whether it's bringing people together through an application or developing a dynamic brand to change the world, I believe that inspired teams yield inspirational results.      						<h3>Education</h3>
