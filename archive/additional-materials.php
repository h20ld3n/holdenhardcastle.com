        <h3>Gestalt psychology has contributed valuable research and experimentation in the area of perception, collecting data and searching for the significance of visual patterns, as well as finding how the human organism sees and organizes visual input and articulates visual output.</h3>
        <p> Together, the physical and the psychological are relative and not absolute. Every visual pattern has a dynamic quality that cannot be defined intellectually, emotionally, or mechanically by size or direction or shape, or distance. These stimuli are only the static measurements, but the psychophysical forces they set off, like those of any stimuli, modify space and arrange or derange balance. Together they create the perception of a design of an environment or a thin. All things visual are not just something that happened out there. They are visual events, total occurrences, and actions that incorporate the creation into the whole.</p>

        <h3>The final result is the artist's true statement</h3>
        <p><strong>But meaning also depsends on the response of the viewer, who also modifies and interprets through the net of subjective judgement.</strong></p>
        <p>One factor alone is common currency between artist and audience, in fact, amoung all peopleâ€”the physical system of their visual perceptions, the psychophysiological componenets of the nervous system, the mechanical workings, the sensory apparatus through which they see.</p>

        <h3>The act of seeing involves a response to light</h3>
        <p><strong>The most important and necessary element in the visual experience is tonal.</strong></p>
        <p>All the other visual elements are revealed to us through light, but they are secondary to the element of tone, which is, in fact light of the absence of light. What light reveals and offeres us in substance by which man fashions and devises what he recognizes and identifies in the environment, namely all the other visual elements: <u>line, color, shape, direction, texture, scale, dimension, motion</u>. Which elements dominate which visual statements is determined by the nature of what is being designed or, in the case of nature what exist. But when we define painting elementally as tonal, filled with shape reference and consequently direction, having texture and tonec-color, possibly scale reference and no dimension and motion except by implication, it does not even begin to define the visual potential of painting. The possible variations of a visual statement that fits neatly within that description is literally infinite. Those variations depend on the artist's subjective expression through emphasis of certain elements over others and the manipulation of those elemnes through the strategic choice of techniques. In these choices, the artist finds meaning.</p>

        <h3>Perception and visual communication</h3>
        <p><strong>Meaning in visual message-making lies not only in the cumulative effects of the arrangement of the basic elements but also in the perceptual mechanism that is universally shared by the human organism.</strong></p>
        <p>More simply put: we create a design out of many colors and shapes and textures and tones and relative proportions; we relate these elements interactively; we intend meaning. The result is the composition, the artist's or photographer's or designer's intention. It is their input. Seeing is another and seperate step in visual communication. It is the process of absorbing information into the nervous system through the eyes, the sense of sight. This process and capacity is shared by all people on a more or less common basis, finding its signifigance in terms of shared meaning. The two seperate steps, seeing and designing and / or making are interdependant for bothing meaning in a general sense and message in the case of attempting to respond to a specific communication. Between the general meaning, mood, or ambience of visual inforamtion and a specific, defined message lies yet another area of visual meaning, functionality, in the objects that are designed, made, and manufactured to serve a purpose. While it would seem that the message of such works is secondary to their viability, the facts prove otherwise. Clothes, houses, public buildingsm even whittling and scrimshaw of amatuer craftsman tell us an enourmous amount about the people who designed and chose them. And our understandin of a culture depends on out study of the world they built and the tools and artificats an art they created.</p>

        <h3>Composition</h3>
        <p><strong>The syntactical guidelines for visual literacy</strong></p>
        <p>The process of composition is the most crucial step in visual problem solving. The rsult of the compositional decisions set the purpose and meaning of the visual statemen and carry strong implications for what the viewer recieves. It is at the vital stage in the creative process that the visual communicator has the strongest control of the woek and the greatest opportunity to express the total mood the work is intended to convey. But the visual mode offers no proscribed structural systems that are absolut. How can we gain control of out complex visual means with some certainty of the shared meaning in the final results? IN language syntax means the orderly arrangement of words in their appropriate form and order. The rules are defined: all one has to do is learn them and use them intelligently. But syntax in the context of visual literacy can only mean the orderly arrangement of parts, leaving us with the problem of how we can approach the process of composition with intelligence and knowledge og how compistional decisions will affect the final result. There are no absolute rules, but there is a great deal of understanding of what will occur in terms of meaning if we make certain arrangements of the parts toward organizing and orchestrating the visual means. Many of the guidelines for understanding the meaning in visual form, the syntactical potential of structure in the visual literacy, stem from the investigation of the process of human perception.</p>
