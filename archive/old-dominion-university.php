        				<h2>I probably had a pretty standard college expierence. It was better than high-school, that's the way I like to remember it.</h2>
                   		<p>I spent three years swimming, going to parties, and trying to figure out what I wanted to do. I was as serious as college students can be about design and what was next my Senior Year, after spending a summer in California.</p>
						<p>I don't really know anyone that I went to college with.</p>

          				<h3>Theatre of the&nbsp;Absurd</h3>
          				<p>While working on "the absurd posters", discussions about the college student audience, lifestyle, and sexuality where rampant. The cyclical, repetitive, and often meaningless activities of the undergrad defined the monkey spanking the monkey image. The monkey image was the first of a series of illustrations created specifically for the posters. Later ideas of scale, cliche, and dated icons surfaced and defined the look and feel of the posters.</p>

          				<h3>Virginia Air &amp; Space Posters</h3>
        				<p>Attik Designs heavily influenced the work created when the Virginia Air and Space Center asked me to create some cool educational posters, that kids would want to pin up in their rooms. The posters had to live next to supermodels, cars, magazine pullouts and rock stars. The strong imagery of the Space Shuttle launch and jets flying straight on center were enhanced with illustrations and interpretations of aerodynamic patterns.</p></div>
