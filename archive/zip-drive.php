          <h3>Zip Drive</h3> 
          <p>A removable floppy disk storage system that was introduced by Iomega in late 1994. Considered medium-to-high-capacity at the time of its release, Zip disks were originally launched with capacities of 100 MB, then 250 MB, and finally 750 MB.</p>
          <p>The format became the most popular of the superfloppy products which filled a niche in the late 1990s portable storage market. However, it was never popular enough to replace the 3+1‚ÅÑ2-inch floppy disk. Zip drives fell out of favor for mass portable storage during the early 2000s as CD-RW and USB flash drives became prevalent. The Zip brand later covered internal and external CD writers known as Zip-650 or Zip-CD, despite the dissimilar technology.</p>

        <h3>Gestalt psychology has contributed valuable research and experimentation in the area of perception, collecting data and searching for the significance of visual patterns, as well as finding how the human organism sees and organizes visual input and articulates visual output.</h3>
        <p> Together, the physical and the psychological are relative and not absolute. Every visual pattern has a dynamic quality that cannot be defined intellectually, emotionally, or mechanically by size or direction or shape, or distance. These stimuli are only the static measurements, but the psychophysical forces they set off, like those of any stimuli, modify space and arrange or derange balance. Together they create the perception of a design of an environment or a thin. All things visual are not just something that happened out there. They are visual events, total occurrences, and actions that incorporate the creation into the whole.</p>
