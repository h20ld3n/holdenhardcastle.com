          				<h3>AEE Letterhead<br> and Branding</h3>
          				<p>Tom Steyer co-founded Advanced Energy Economy to engage with companies in order to create a more prosperous world that runs on secure, clean, and affordable energy.</p>
          				<p>The design values complement the company vision. The brand guidelines aim to create a consistent, clean, and efficient experience. This solid foundation allows for evolution. Corporate logos, iconography, infographics, reports, responsive websites, and members of the AEE team, have played a part in the progression of the brand.</p>

          				<h3>AEE Website and<br> Process Redesign</h3>
          				<p>AEE engages member companies and recruits partners through education and encourages participation in energy policy changing initiatives. Policy and legislation changes quickly. In order to keep up emerging energy regulations, the AEE website needed to be redesigned and migrated to a content management system (CMS). By implementing a CMS, projects leads would be able to make timely content updates.</p>
          				<p>Working with the communications, marketing and development teams, we identified and implemented specific improvements on both the front and backend. By building templates on a flexible and responsive Bootstrap foundation, content updates became more efficient and streamlined the look and feel of the site.</p>

          				<h3>Advanced Energy<br> Economy Reports</h3>
          				<p>The educational reports focus on the technical, economic, social, and political issues surrounding advanced energy and how to improve the energy sector. To engage member companies the reports are available for download, distributed at events, and presented at congressional hearings.</p>
						<p>We implemented newly established brand guidelines to define and apply consistent visual hierarchies and styles to reports. Covers communicate the subject of the complex reports in a single image. By using a grid system and dynamically linking text to design files, the annual and semi-annual reports were seamlessly designed and produced. The powerful imagery and iconography create a visual message that accelerates the transition to an advanced energy economy.</p>
          				<p>The California Advanced Energy Employment Survey report won a 2015 American Graphic Design Award.</p>

          				<h3>Ohio's Electricity<br> Future Report</h3>
          				<p>The Ohio Advanced Energy Economy, an Advanced Energy Economy State Partner, was looking to create brand guidelines and an annual report that appealed to their members. They reached out to AEE to create impactful design standards that represented their messaging.</p>
          				<p>A logo, font face, and collateral were structured around the&nbsp;established AEE design guidelines. The newly created brand visually identified Ohio as part of the extended AEE family.</p>
          				<p>The report on the state of Ohio's Electricity Future won a 2015 American Graphic Design Award.</p>

          				<p>Advanced Energy Economy initiative leads present data and reports to companies and legislatures across all levels of government. Infographics were created to present complex information and tell the story behind the energy data in an easily understandable way.</p>
						<p>We distilled complex data down to identify key messaging. The resulting visuals were designed to support arguments that move executives and government officials to action.</p>
          				<p>The North Carolina: Clean Energy Works! and California Advanced Energy Employment Future infographics both won 2015 American Graphic Design Awards.</p>
