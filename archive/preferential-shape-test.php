          				<h3>The equidistant cross</h3>
						<p>The equidistant cross, the plus sign, universally symbolizes the process of relationship and integration. This is a coupling, synthesizing, integrating and balancing process. This process carries the need for connection—to a creative project, to a group, to another person, or to oneself. It is the symbol that demonstrates integration and balanced connection.</p>
						<p>People who favor the cross will place emphasis on the quality not the quantity , of the time shared with others. Experienceing balance will be an essential goal for them. The individuals will often ask for a specific meeting time ; they love collaborative work; and the equate quality of time spent in the company of colleagues and close firends with love and trust.</p>
						<p>For other who want to support people who are in the cross process, it is important to be responsive to their stated needs, to honor their requests for shared time and activities, to be cooperative, and to express caring. </p>
						<p><i>Your relationship to your own heroic journey is made more clear by your relationship with the circle.</i></p>
						<p>The underlying fear associated with the process of relationship is the feat of loss, abondonment, and isolation. When the process of relationship, or needed connection, is taken to an extreme, personal identity can be lost if the individual tries to live life through another person or through a group.</p>

          				<h3>The circle</h3>
						<p>In every culture the circle symbolizes wholeness and the experience of unity. When people are engaged in the search for wholeness they aspire to independence and individuation. What they need most is space, room in which to find themselves and develop their own identity. What they fear most is entrapment, being caught in a situation that will restrict or restrain them.</p>
						<p>Those who are undergoig the process of individuation will feel loved and trusted when allowed plenty of space. If the space they need is not offered to themm they will simply take it. When the process of individuation is resisted or not allowed to come to resolution, it may become intensely self-absorbing, even narcissistic.</p>
						<p>The thrust toward individuation is represented in Eastern cultures by the circular form of the mandala. One representation in Western cultures is the circular business logo that asserts uniqueness of corporate identity. The circle is found in the art of every culture and time. From Native American medicine wheels to Hawaiian Menehune rings, the circle remains humankind's primary symbol for unity and stands for the mythic them of individuation.</p>
						<p>Mythologist Joseph Campbell reminds us in book, <i>The Hero With a Thousand Faces</i>, that the mythes most associated with the process of individuation are the stories every culture tells about its heros and heroines. At first these tales were passed from one generation to the next orally—in poem, story, and song. Later written literature grew from the oral tradition. The journey of the hero or heroine is a universal myth found in the lore of all cultures, including Greece, Rome, Asia Africa, Nordic and Oceanic societies, the Americas, and the contemporary indigenous folk groups.</p>
						<p>These tales, bothe acient and modern, continue to encourage and inspire us. Stories for children and daily life experiences hold heroic themes. We are often reminded of the courageous accomplishments of heros and heroines such as Prometheus, Psyche, David, Samson, Sigurd, Cu Chulainn, Lancelot, Galahad, Paul Bunyan, Cassandra, Odin, Joan of Arc, Pele, Coyote, Buffalo Woman, Obaluwaye, Quan Yin, Maira, <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>, Dorthey from <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>, and countless others.</p>
						<p>All heroic myths describe the process of individuation and the reclamation of self. The stories recount simple beginnings, intiations, identified strengths and resourcefulness, victorious struggles with powerful forces, resolving of issues regarding <i>hubris</i> or pride, and the exploration of persistent unanswered questions. Near the end of the journey betrayal is often rectified or a courageous saccrafice is accomplished in triumph or in despair, through death or a new beginning.</p>
						<p>Often, we have important long-standing questions that provike our won heroic journeys. In the modern-day stoy of individuation, <i>Feeling Good About Grandma</i>, Emily has a question about whether someone can see if she has a black heart. She begins her own journey by unraveling this questions, which allows her to discover her hearts true color.</p>
						<p>The ancient Australian myth about Kunapipi sheds additional light on this process in conveying to us that each journey is connected to a spiritual source, to a creative dream that inspires us to become out heroic selves and join with other heroes and heroines to expand ancestral roots and create new worlds.</p>
						<p><i>What heros or heroines do you identify with? Those that come to mind have been and will continue to be important sources of inspiration for you in your individuation process.</i></p>
						<p><i>What signifigance do circular shapes have for you? Do youn notice them everywhere you look, or not at all? Do you draw them in your doodles? Are you strongley attracted to or repelled by them?</i></p>
						<p><i>Your relationship to your own heroic journey is made more clear by your relationship with the circle.</i></p>
						<p><i>Position 1: Indicates a desire to be independent and self-sufficient.</i></p>
						<p><i>Position 2: The herioc journey is effortless, you are self reliant and resourceful.</i></p>
						<p><i>Position 3: Individuation is occuring at your core of your nature. When fully engaged, this process of achieving and expierencing independence will allow your natural creative and restoritive abilities yo flow into all areas of your life.</i></p>
						<p><i>Position 4: A past heroic journey motivated you to become responsible and self-reliant. The process of individuation was a challenge in the past that caused you to move to your present state.</i></p>
						<p><i>You may be resisting ot denying the process of individuation. The heroic journey currently does not have you attention and you have no interest in exploring it.</i></p>
