                   		<p style="font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', 'DejaVu Serif', Georgia, 'serif'">Rudy: I should start off this conversation by saying that I found <i>Ray Gun 6</i> to be brilliant and a milestone issue design-wise. I remember being at Tower Books, picking up that issue and just browsing through it, and being really amazed. I was flipping through it from back to front, so I started with the review section…<strong style="font-family:Gotham, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'sans-serif'">David: I’ve actually thought that might be a good way to do magazines, from back to front, since so many people look at them that way.</strong></p>

						<p style="font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', 'DejaVu Serif', Georgia, 'serif'">R: I thought the review section was just really, really nice and it's difficult to put how it affected me into words becuase it was truly a gut feeling, especially...<strong style="font-family:Gotham, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'sans-serif'"> D: I actually felt that to be our weakest review section yet. But I like the idea of the work eliciting a "gut reaction."</strong> R: Standing there at the Tower Books newsstand, with about two thousand different magazines on the shelves, and yet you just know you are not going to find this approach in a whole lot of magazones, if in any at all. I've looked at all issues of <i>Ray Gun</i> and I do think there are hits and misses from page to page. <strong style="font-family:Gotham, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'sans-serif'">D: I agree.</strong> R: Overall, I believe <i>Ray Gun</i> succeeds, better than any music magazone, in visualizing "alternative" rock. And when you look at all the issues you've put out, I felt issue 6 was the best. So far, all the issues have been eye openers, but if I had to pick one, this would be it. And again, it has a lot to do with how I quickly went through it. Perhpas if I sat down and studied it, looke at all the spreads and all the issues, another issue would come forward. But that one just kicked me right in the head. <strong style="font-family:Gotham, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'sans-serif'">D: I am never completely happy with an issue. There are always some pages I like and some I don't.</strong> R: Perhaps that's what makes you want to fo on to the next one? <strong style="font-family:Gotham, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'sans-serif'">D: That's part of it. I think it would be a bad sign if I were completely satisfied with an issue.</strong> R: You are, of course, creating towering expectations when you design these brilliant issues; you have to constantly outdo yourself. <strong style="font-family:Gotham, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'sans-serif'">D: Is that a pressure you feel with Emigre?</strong> R: Absolutely. <strong style="font-family:Gotham, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'sans-serif'">D: With twenty-six and a half issues, do you feel jaded at all, or are you still excited about upcoming issues?</strong> R: Yes, I am excited about upcoming issues, but there are other things that have started to interest me as much as the design, such as doing interviews. You would think in any profession, although perhaps this is more true with crafts, the morc you do it, the better you get at it. But with graphic design, if you have any integrity and if you constantly challenge yourself, I think it only gets more difficult. <strong style="font-family:Gotham, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'sans-serif'">D: I agree. That's when you open yourself up to more mistakes and the extremes of creating some really good work and some really bad work. I believe if you're not making some of those mistakes, you are probably not progressing.</strong> R: Do you feel it's getting tougher and tougher? <strong style="font-family:Gotham, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'sans-serif'">D: No, not yet. But I am only at Issue 8.</strong> R: But you have <i>Beach Culture</i> behind you. <strong style="font-family:Gotham, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'sans-serif'">D: Even with Beach Culture, that puts me up to 14. You've still done almost twice as many issues as I have. Since every article has its own content and angle, they all require different thought processes and solutions. That's what keeps me interested.</strong> R: The topics, somewhat shifted from <i>Beach Culture</i> to <i>Ray Gun</i>, which must have given you some of an injections of new thoughts. <strong style="font-family:Gotham, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'sans-serif'"> D: In some ways it shifted and in some ways it didn't. Ray Gun is a bit more focused, which can be good or bad.You can only do so many band bios. But they're all different bands and it's a challenge to interpret the different personalities or styles or music in appropriate ways.</strong> R: About the jaded thing, front <i>Emigre</i> 10 on, we have heard opinions and received letterss, saying that what we do is old hat... <strong style="font-family:Gotham, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'sans-serif'">D: That was a big difference for me in doing <i>Ray Gun</i> versus <i>Beach Culture</i>. With <i>Ray Gun</i>, people were actually able to find copies from the start. We got letters from all over the country from people who had never seen <i>Beach Culture</i>. They'd express amazement at this type of work, which they'd never seen before. And I'd be thinking "What do you mean? The stuff's been around for a while."</strong> R: And that 's nic e. We've been around for ten years and... <strong style="font-family:Gotham, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'sans-serif'">D: Is that a plus or a minus?</strong> R: We're still alive and we're still doing what we·vc set out to do. <strong style="font-family:Gotham, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'sans-serif'">D: What did you set out to do?</strong> R: Among other things, work for ourselves and be independent. Before <i>Emigre</i>, I worked for other people, I worked at the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> for three years and in Holland I worked for three years for different studios. When we realized that we could run our own business, that became very important. That's in a sense what we set out to do. And we were able to do it, not by publishing a magazine, because that, by no means, pays the bills, but by selling typefaces. <strong style="font-family:Gotham, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'sans-serif'">D: There is a type designer in Canada who told me you had expressed to him how glad you were that you would never have to do any more freelance work, because the type business was so good. Is that true?</strong> R: I was happy not having to deal with clients' wishes and compromises anymore, because I felt I wasn't able lo do what I wanted. Zuzana Licko and I just simply started to focus our energy and poured it into our type foundry and magazine. I had worked as a designer for clients for quite some time. I' ve talked to many designers who would love to do their own thing as opposed to working for other people. But I still do occasional commercial design jobs. I am doing an illustra1ion for you for <i>Ray Gun</i> right now. <strong style="font-family:Gotham, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'sans-serif'">D: For free , I might add. Do you ever feel that resentment from other designers and their criticism is somehow tied to the fact that they wish they had the freedom that you've got?</strong> R: One cri1icism we often get is that the work can look "good" because we don't work for a client. I can understand why they think that. You must get that type of criticism also? <strong style="font-family:Gotham, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'sans-serif'">D: Occasionally, but I do have a client. Thousands of them in fact, in the form of readers and subscribers. In away, the publisher Marvin Jarrett, is my client, as are the people who advertise with us.</strong> R: But you have a fair amount of freedom? <strong style="font-family:Gotham, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'sans-serif'">D: Yes , I do. I've always tried to work with clients and projects that allow me that freedom.</strong> </p>
