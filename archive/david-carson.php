                   		<p style="font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', 'DejaVu Serif', Georgia, 'serif'">Rudy: I should start off this conversation by saying that I found <i>Ray Gun 6</i> to be brilliant and a milestone issue design-wise. I remember being at Tower Books, picking up that issue and just browsing through it, and being really amazed. I was flipping through it from back to front, so I started with the review section…<strong id="dc">David: I’ve actually thought that might be a good way to do magazines, from back to front, since so many people look at them that way.</strong></p>

						<p style="font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', 'DejaVu Serif', Georgia, 'serif'">R: I thought the review section was just really, really nice and it's difficult to put how it affected me into words becuase it was truly a gut feeling, especially...<strong id="dc"> D: I actually felt that to be our weakest review section yet. But I like the idea of the work eliciting a "gut reaction."</strong> R: Standing there at the Tower Books newsstand, with about two thousand different magazines on the shelves, and yet you just know you are not going to find this approach in a whole lot of magazones, if in any at all. I've looked at all issues of <i>Ray Gun</i> and I do think there are hits and misses from page to page. <strong id="dc">D: I agree.</strong> R: Overall, I believe <i>Ray Gun</i> succeeds, better than any music magazone, in visualizing "alternative" rock. And when you look at all the issues you've put out, I felt issue 6 was the best. So far, all the issues have been eye openers, but if I had to pick one, this would be it. And again, it has a lot to do with how I quickly went through it. Perhpas if I sat down and studied it, looke at all the spreads and all the issues, another issue would come forward. But that one just kicked me right in the head. <strong id="dc">D: I am never completely happy with an issue. There are always some pages I like and some I don't.</strong> R: Perhaps that's what makes you want to fo on to the next one? <strong id="dc">D: That's part of it. I think it would be a bad sign if I were completely satisfied with an issue.</strong> R: You are, of course, creating towering expectations when you design these brilliant issues; you have to constantly outdo yourself. <strong id="dc">D: Is that a pressure you feel with Emigre?</strong> R: Absolutely. <strong id="dc">D: With twenty-six and a half issues, do you feel jaded at all, or are you still excited about upcoming issues?</strong> R: Yes, I am excited about upcoming issues, but there are other things that have started to interest me as much as the design, such as doing interviews. You would think in any profession, although perhaps this is more true with crafts, the morc you do it, the better you get at it. But with graphic design, if you have any integrity and if you constantly challenge yourself, I think it only gets more difficult. <strong id="dc">D: I agree. That's when you open yourself up to more mistakes and the extremes of creating some really good work and some really bad work. I believe if you're not making some of those mistakes, you are probably not progressing.</strong> R: Do you feel it's getting tougher and tougher? <strong id="dc">D: No, not yet. But I am only at Issue 8.</strong> R: But you have <i>Beach Culture</i> behind you. <strong id="dc">D: Even with Beach Culture, that puts me up to 14. You've still done almost twice as many issues as I have. Since every article has its own content and angle, they all require different thought processes and solutions. That's what keeps me interested.</strong> R: The topics, somewhat shifted from <i>Beach Culture</i> to <i>Ray Gun</i>, which must have given you some of an injections of new thoughts. <strong id="dc"> D: In some ways it shifted and in some ways it didn't. Ray Gun is a bit more focused, which can be good or bad.You can only do so many band bios. But they're all different bands and it's a challenge to interpret the different personalities or styles or music in appropriate ways.</strong> R: About the jaded thing, front <i>Emigre</i> 10 on, we have heard opinions and received letterss, saying that what we do is old hat... <strong id="dc">D: That was a big difference for me in doing <i>Ray Gun</i> versus <i>Beach Culture</i>. With <i>Ray Gun</i>, people were actually able to find copies from the start. We got letters from all over the country from people who had never seen <i>Beach Culture</i>. They'd express amazement at this type of work, which they'd never seen before. And I'd be thinking "What do you mean? The stuff's been around for a while."</strong> R: And that 's nic e. We've been around for ten years and... <strong id="dc">D: Is that a plus or a minus?</strong> R: We're still alive and we're still doing what we·vc set out to do. <strong id="dc">D: What did you set out to do?</strong> R: Among other things, work for ourselves and be independent. Before <i>Emigre</i>, I worked for other people, I worked at the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> for three years and in Holland I worked for three years for different studios. When we realized that we could run our own business, that became very important. That's in a sense what we set out to do. And we were able to do it, not by publishing a magazine, because that, by no means, pays the bills, but by selling typefaces. <strong id="dc">D: There is a type designer in Canada who told me you had expressed to him how glad you were that you would never have to do any more freelance work, because the type business was so good. Is that true?</strong> R: I was happy not having to deal with clients' wishes and compromises anymore, because I felt I wasn't able lo do what I wanted. Zuzana Licko and I just simply started to focus our energy and poured it into our type foundry and magazine. I had worked as a designer for clients for quite some time. I' ve talked to many designers who would love to do their own thing as opposed to working for other people. But I still do occasional commercial design jobs. I am doing an illustra1ion for you for <i>Ray Gun</i> right now. <strong id="dc">D: For free , I might add. Do you ever feel that resentment from other designers and their criticism is somehow tied to the fact that they wish they had the freedom that you've got?</strong> R: One cri1icism we often get is that the work can look "good" because we don't work for a client. I can understand why they think that. You must get that type of criticism also? <strong id="dc">D: Occasionally, but I do have a client. Thousands of them in fact, in the form of readers and subscribers. In away, the publisher Marvin Jarrett, is my client, as are the people who advertise with us.</strong> R: But you have a fair amount of freedom? <strong id="dc">D: Yes , I do. I've always tried to work with clients and projects that allow me that freedom.</strong> </p>

						<p style="font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', 'DejaVu Serif', Georgia, 'serif'">R: The hidden message when people criticize our work is that there are no parameters; it can be anything we want it to be. They don't understand that therc are many restrictions, not least because we have to pay the bill. And that's a huge restriction, because we don't have very large budgets for <i>Emigre</i>. <strong id="dc">D: I think you have more freedom even than I do because you are basically a trade magazine. <i>Beach Culture</i> and <i>Ray Gun</i> are consumer magazines.</strong> R: Sometimes it is intimidating to have so much freedom. <strong id="dc">D: If you did a consumer magazine, do you think you would do it in the same style as you do <i>Emigre</i>?</strong> R: It depends on the magazine. I've workcd on consumer magazines. I also worked at a daily newspaper, where practically no1hing was possible because there were one hundred editors and they looked at you as a facilitator, a glorified paste-up person. The paper was put togethcer by the editors and they had very particular ideas about how it should look. We just followed their instructions. <strong id="dc">D: Were you continually frustrated in that position or was it satisfying for a while?</strong> R: It had its good points, certainly. The Sunday inserts allowed for some creative work. I worked on other magazines, too. I designed <i>Shift</i>, an art magazine, and I did the base layout for <i>MacWeek</i>, a weekly computer magazine, and neither looked any1hing like <i>Emigre</i>. But with MacWeek, I fell out of place and that I really failed, mostly because I wasn't in line with the publisher. They had very specific ideas. They wanted it to look like <i>AdWeek</i>; they had such a preset notion about how their magazine should look and it was so different from what I wanted it to be. And I'm not a very good salesman. It just never quite worked out. <strong id="dc">D: That must be a major plus when doing your own magazine-you don't have to sell it to anybody.</strong> 
							R: Exactly. Except in the encl, I do have to sell niy 7,000 cop­ies. It sounds so easy, "You can do what you want." Bui ultin1a1ely, I can only do it if I am able 10 sell 1he magazine so that at leasl it pays for itself. We can not run it with a loss. O: In that respect, I'm In much the same position with Ray Gun. Do your sales of Emigre fluctuate much from issue lo issue? R: No, it's pretty steady. £11,igre #25, which was devoted to and created by a group of young designers in Holland, sold pretty well because there were a few Dutch distributors that aggressively sold it in Holland. But other than that, they all do the same. We have 2,000 subscribers and 3,000 copies pre-sold to stores and foreign distributors and the re,naining 2,000 we sell over tin1e. D: When you first called me to do an Interview In early spring '92, I agreed immediately and we set it up for the next day. I arrived at the right time and all there was was a message from you saying that I was "getting too much publicity" and the interview had been canceled. I was always curious why that made you want to cancel the Interview? R: Shortly after we had 111ade the arrangen1en1 for that telephone interview (for £111- igre 22, the Nick Bell issue) son1ebody had faxed 1ne a copy of the article in Print n1agazine about you that had just been published, and, as you've done on a number of occasions, you ,nentioned our fonts in a not so kind way, and it sin1ply rubbed ,ne the wrong way. D: You have brought that up a couple of times and I think you are referring to the reference I made that some of the fonts seem to get dated real quickly, and almost completely disappear from use. Would you disagree with that? R: No I fully agree with 1hat. D: Then I guess I am confused about your feelings. R: The fact that they are dated doesn't make 1hen1 bad, </p>
