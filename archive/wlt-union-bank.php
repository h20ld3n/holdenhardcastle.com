          				<p>If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. I'm going to mix up a little color. We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Play with the angles.</p>
