          				<h3>Scale</h3>
						<p>All visual elements have the capacity to modify and define each other. The process, itself, is the element of scale. Color is bright or subdued depending on juxtaposition, just as relative tonal values take on enormous visual modifications depending on what tone is next to or behind them. In other words, there can be no large without small. But even when large is established through small, the entire scale can be changed with the addition of another visual modification. Scale can be determined not only through relative size of visual clues but also through relationships to the field or the environment. The visible results concerning scale are fluid and not absolute since they are subject to so many variables of modification. All that is being observed is true in the context of scale.</p>

          				<h3>DO NOT TOUCH!</h3>
						<p>Texture has reference to the composition of a substance through minute variations on the surface material. Texture should serve as a sensitive and enriching experience. Unfortunately, those "DO NOT TOUCH! signs in the expensive shops overlap into social behavior, and we are strongly conditioned not to touch things or people with anything approximating sensual involvement. The result is a minimal tactile experience and even a fear of tactile contact; the sense of blind touch is carefully guarded in sighted people. We act super-cautiously when blindfolded or in the dark, reaching out tentatively, and, because of our limited experience of touch, we often do not recognize a texture. At the 1967 Montreal Expo, the 5+ Comingo Pavilion was designed for visitors to explore the quality of their five senses. It was a popular and enjoyable exhibit. People sniffed away at a series of funnels offering a variety of odors, even though they suspected, and justifiably, that some would be unpleasant. They listened, they looked, they tasted, but they stood hesitantly and inhibited in front of the yawning holes designed to be reached into blindly. What did they fear? it appears that the natural, free, "hands-on" investigative approach of the baby and a young child has been conditioned out of the adult by—Who knows what?—the Anglo-Saxon ethic, Puritan repression, instinctive taboos. Whatever the reason, the result starves one of our richest senses. But in this increasingly simulated and plastic world, the problem arises infrequently. Most of our textural experience is optical, not tactile. Not only is texture faked rather convincingly in plastics and printed material and faked fur, but, also, much of what we see that is painted, photographed, and filmed convincingly presents texture that is not there. If we ouch a photograph of silky velvet, we do not have the convincing tactile experience the visual clues promise. Meaning is based on what we see. This fakery is an essential factor in survival in nature; animals, birds, reptiles, insects, fish, take on the coloration and texture of their surroundings as a protection against predators. Man copies this camouflage method in war in response to the same needs for survival that inspires it in nature.</p>

          				<h3>Texture</h3>
						<p>Texture is the visual element that frequently serves as a stand-in for the qualities of another sense, touching. But in fact, we can appreciate and recognize texture either by touch or by sight individually, or by a combination of both. It is possible for a texture to have no tactile quality, only optical, like the lines of type on a printed page, or polka dots on material, or cross-hatched lines on a doodle. Where there is actual texture, the tactile and optical qualities coexist, not like tone and color which are unified, affording individual sensation to the eye and hand, even though we project onto both strong associative meaning. What sandpapers looks like and what sandpaper feels like have the same intellectual meaning, but not the same value. They are singular experiences which may or may not suggest each other under certain circumstances. The judgment of the eye is usually checked on by the hand by actual touching. Is it smooth or does it just look that way? Is that an indentation or a raised mark? No wonder there are so many " DO NOT TOUCH! signs. </p>

          				<h3>The force is strong</h3>
						<p>Since perception of color is the single most strongly emotional part of the visual process, it has great force and can be utilized to express and reinforce visual information to significant advantage. Color not only has universally shared meaning through experience, but it also has separate worth informationally through symbolically attached meaning. In addition to the highly negotiable color meaning, each of us has our own personal and subjective color preferences. We choose our own color statements and settings, but there is little analytic thought or concern about what methods or motivation we use to arrive at our own choices regarding the meaning and effect of color. When a jockey dons an owners silks, a soldier wears his dress uniform, and a nation displays its flag, the attempt to find symbolic meaning in their colors may be obvious. Not so in our personal color choices, which are less symbolic and therefore less clearly defined. Nevertheless, whether we think about it or not, realize it or not, we tell the world a great deal when we make a color choice.</p>

          				<h3>Complementary colors</h3>
						<p>There is another way of demonstrating this process. Two complementary colors displayed on the same middle tone of gray affect the neutral tone. The gray panel with a warm, red-orange hue appears bluish or cool, while the reverse occurs with the gray on which a blue-green square is displayed. Its gray background appears reddish-toned and warm. This experiment shows that the eye is seeing the opposite or contrasting hue, not just in the afterimage, but at the same time, it is viewing a color. The process is called "simultaneous contrast," and its psychophysiological significance extends beyond just its importance to color theory. It is another piece of evidence that indicated the intense need to reach for complete neutrality and hence complete repose that man demonstrates over and over again in the visual context.</p>

          				<h3>Afterimage</h3>
						<p>An afterimage is the physiological visual phenomenon that takes place after the human eye has been fixed or focused on any visual information. When the object or information being stared at is replaced with a blank white field, a negative image is seen on the blank space. The effect is related to the spots one sees after bright lights are directed into the eye. Although this is an extreme example, any image of color produces the complementary color or its exact opposite. It is on this visual phenomenon that Munsell based the entire structure of his color theory. The opposite color on his color wheel is what afterimage would be. There are further implications of what happens when you stare at a color long enough to produce an afterimage. You will first see the complementary color. For instance, if you stare at yellow, purple will appear on the blank area in your afterimage. Yellow is the closest hue to white or light; purple the closest to black or dark. The afterimage will not only be tonally darker than the value of yellow but will be the median tone of gray. A red of a middle tonal value would produce a complementary green of the same middle tone. The afterimage then appears to react in the same tonal fashion as the pigment. When you mix two complementary colors, red and green, yellow and purple, they not only can cancel out each other's chroma or hue to gray, they also produce from their mixture a middle tone of gray.  </p>

          				<h3>3rd dimension</h3>
						<p>The third, and last dimension of color is achromatic. It is the relative brightness, from light to dark, of value or tonal gradations. It must be noted, underlined, and emphasized that the presence or absence of color does not affect tone; it is a constant. A color television is an excellent device for demonstrating this visual fact. When you turn the color knobs slowly to black and white, to the monochromatic picture, you slowly drain off the color saturation. The process in no way affects the tonal value of the picture. Turning the saturation up and down demonstrates the constancy of tone and proves that color and tone coexist in perception without modifying each other. </p>

          				<h3>2nd dimension</h3>
						<p>The second dimension of color is saturation, which is the relative purity of color from the hue to gray. Saturated color is pure, almost primitive, and always given preference by folk artists and children. It is both uncomplicated and overstated, composed of the primary and secondary hues. The less saturated colors reach toward neutrality of color, even noncolor, and are subtle and restful. The more intensely saturated the coloration of the visual object or event, the more highly charged it is with the expression and emotion—informational results in the choice of saturated or neutralized color based choice on intention. But saturation or its absence as a meaningful visual effect is the difference between the dentist's office and the Electric Circus.</p>

          				<h3>Color wheel</h3>
						<p>Color structure in its simplest formulation is taught through the color wheel. The primary colors, yellow, red, blue, and secondary colors, orange, green, violet, are invariably included in such a chart. However, it usually also includes expanded mixtures of at least twelve hues. From this simple chart of a color wheel, multiple variations of color hues can be developed.</p>

          				<h3>Three dimensions</h3>
						<p>Color has three dimensions which can be defined and measured. Hue is the color itself, or chroma, of which there are more than a hundred. Each hue has individual characteristics; group or categories of colors share common effects. There are three primary or elementary hues: yellow, red, blue. Each represents qualities that are fundamental. Yellow is the color considered closest to light and warmth; red is the most emotional and active; blue is passive and soft. Yellow and red tend to expand, blue contract. In association with each, through moxtures, new meanings take over. Red, which is a provoking hue, is subdued when it is mixed with blue and activated when it is combined with yellow. The same changes in effect are reached with yellow, which mellows when it is mixed with blue. </p>
