          				<h3>2nd dimension</h3>
						<p>The second dimension of color is saturation, which is the relative purity of color from the hue to gray. Saturated color is pure, almost primitive, and always given preference by folk artists and children. It is both uncomplicated and overstated, composed of the primary and secondary hues. The less saturated colors reach toward neutrality of color, even noncolor, and are subtle and restful. The more intensely saturated the coloration of the visual object or event, the more highly charged it is with the expression and emotionâ€”informational results in the choice of saturated or neutralized color based choice on intention. But saturation or its absence as a meaningful visual effect is the difference between the dentist's office and the Electric Circus. </p>

          				<h3>Color wheel</h3>
						<p>Color structure in its simplest formulation is taught through the color wheel. The primary colors, yellow, red, blue, and secondary colors, orange, green, violet, are invariably included in such a chart. However, it usually also includes expanded mixtures of at least twelve hues. From this simple chart of a color wheel, multiple variations of color hues can be developed.</p>

          				<h3>Three dimensions</h3>
						<p>Color has three dimensions which can be defined and measured. Hue is the color itself, or chroma, of which there are more than a hundred. Each hue has individual characteristics; group or categories of colors share common effects. There are three primary or elementary hues: yellow, red, blue. Each represents qualities that are fundamental. Yellow is the color considered closest to light and warmth; red is the most emotional and active; blue is passive and soft. Yellow and red tend to expand, blue contract. In association with each, through moxtures, new meanings take over. Red, which is a provoking hue, is subdued when it is mixed with blue and activated when it is combined with yellow. The same changes in effect are reached with yellow, which mellows when it is mixed with blue. </p>
