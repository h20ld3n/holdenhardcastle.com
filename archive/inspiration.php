          				<h3>Perception and visual communication</h3>
						<p>Meaning in visual message-making lies not only in the cumulative effects of the arrangement of the basic elements but also in the perceptual mechanism that is universally shared by the human organism. More simply put; we create a design out many colors and shapes and textures and tones and relative proportions; we relate these elements interactively; we intend meaning. The result is the composition, the artist's or photographer or designer's intention. It is their input. eeing is another and separate step in visual communication. It is the process of absorbing information int the nervous system through the eyes, the sense of sight. This process and capacity are shared by all people on a more or less common basis, finding its significance in terms of shared meaning. The two separate steps, seeing and designing and/or making are interdependent for both meaning in a general sense and message in the case of attempting to respond to specific communication. Between the general meaning, mood, or ambiance of visual information and a specific, defined message lies yet another area of visual meaning, functionality, in the objects that are designed, made and manufactured to serve a purpose. While it would seem that the message of such works is secondary to their visibility, the facts prove otherwise. Clothes, houses, public buildings, even the whittling and scrimshaw of amateur craftsman tell us an enormous amount about the people who design and chose them. And our understanding of a culture depends on our study of the world they built and the tools and artifacts and art they created. </p>

          				<h3>The basic elements of visual communication</h3>
						<p>The process of composition is the most crucial step in visual problem-solving. The result of the compositional decisions set the purpose and meaning of the visual statement and carry strong implications for what the viewer receives. It is at this vital stage in the creative process that the visual communicator has the strongest control of the work and the greatest opportunity to express the total mood of the work is intended to convey. But the visual mode offers no proscribed structural systems that are absolute. How can we gain control of our complex visual means with some certainty of shared meaning in the final result? In language, syntax means the orderly arrangement of words in their appropriate form and order. The rules are defined: all one has to do is learn them and use them intelligently. But syntax in the context of visual literacy can only mean the orderly arrangement of parts, leaving us with the problem of how we can approach the process of composition with intelligence and know of how compositional decisions will affect the final result. There are no absolute rules, but there is a great deal of understanding of what will occur in terms of meaning if we maker certain arrangement of the parts toward organizing and orchestrating the visual means. Many of the guidelines for understanding the meaning in visual form, the syntactical potential of structure in visual literacy, stem from the investigation of the process of human perception. </p>

          				<h3>Composition: The syntactical guidelines for visual literacy</h3>
						<p>These elements, the dot, line, shape, direction, tone, color, texture, scale, dimension, movement, are the fundamental components of the visual media. They are essential ingredients we draw on for the development of visual thinking and communication. They have the dramatic potential for carrying information with simple directness and ease, messages that are effortlessly understandable to anyone who can see. These potentialities for conveying universal meaning universally have been recognized, but not pursued with the determination the situation demands. The instant information of television will make the world into a global village, says McLuhan. Language seperates, nationalizes; the visual anneals. Language is complex and challenging; the visual is as fast as the speed of light and can instantaneously express man ideas. These basic elements are the essential visual means. Proper understanding of their character and workings is the basis for a language that will recognize no boundaries or barriers.</p>

          				<h3>Scanning</h3>
						<p>The eye is continuously scanning the environment in pursuit of the many methods it has for absorbing visual information. The formalized convention of reading, for instance, follows an organized sequence. Scanning, as a method of seeing, appears to be unstructured, yet, random though it may appear, research and measurement show that human scanning patterns are as individual and unique as fingerprints, It can be measured through the projection of light into the eye and recording the reflection in the pupil as the eye looks at something. The eye also moves in response to the unconscious process of measurement and balance through the "felt axis" and left-right, top-bottom preferences. Since two or even all three of these visual methods may be going on at once, it is clear there is action not only in what is seen but also in the process of seeing.</p>

						<p>Some of the properties of "persistence of vision" may be the incorrect reason for the use of the word, "movement," to describe compositional tensions and rhythms in visual data when what is being seen is fixed and unmoving. A painting, photograph, or fabric design may be static, but the amount of repose it projects compositionally may imply movement in response to the artist's design emphasis and intention. There is little rest in the process of seeing. </p>

          				<h3>Movement</h3>
						<p>The visual element of movement, like dimension, is more often implied in the visual mode than expressed. Movement is probably one of the most dominant forces in the human experience. In fact, it exists only in film, television, the charming mobiles of Alexander Calder, and where something visualized and made has a movement component, like machinery or windows. However, techniques can trick the eye; the illusion of texture or dimension appears real through the use of the intense expression of detail, as in the case of texture, and the use of perspective and intensified light and shade as in the case of dimension. The suggestion of motion in static visual statements is at once more laborious to achieve without distorting reality at the same time, implicit in everything we see. It derives from our complete experience of movement in life. In part, this implied action is projected into static visual information both psychologically and kinesthetically. After all, like the tonal world of achromatic film, we accept so readily, the static forms of the visual arts are not natural to our experience. This stilled, frozen world is the best we could create, until the advent of the motion picture and its miracle of representing movement. But note, even in this form, true movement does not exist as we know it; it lies not in the medium, but in the eye of the beholder through the physiological phenomenon of "persistence of vision." Movie film is really a string of still pictures containing slight changes which, when viewed by man in the proper time intervals, are blended together by a holdover factor in seeing so that the movement appears real.</p>

          				<h3>Successful understanding of a problem</h3>
						<p>The design and planning of three-dimensional visual materials requires many steps to think through and project possible solutions. First, there is the sketch, usually in perspective. There may be endless sketches, loose and probing and uncommitted. Second, there are the working drawings which are rigid and mechanical. The technical and engineering requirements of building or manufacturing require these in careful detail. Last, though it is expensive, building a model is probably the only way people with little sensitivity to visualization can be shown how something will appear in its completed form. </p>

						<p>What a lens can see, and record is determined by the focal length of its lens. However, it cannot match the eye without enormous distortion of a fisheye lens. The standard lens has nowhere near the range of field of the eye, but what it does see is close to the perspective of the eye. The telephoto lens can record visual information in ways the eye cannot, collapsing space like an accordion. The wide angle lens broadens the scope of field but covers nowhere near the area of the eyes. Even though we are aware that the camera has its own perspective different from the human eye, one thing is certain; the camera can replicate the environment with startling accuracy and in infinite detail. </p>

						<p>Representation of dimension in two-dimensional visual formats is also dependent on illusion. Dimension exist in the real world. We cannot only feel it but with the aid of our two-eyed, stereopticon sight, we can see it. But in all two-dimensional representations of reality in drawing, painting, photography, film, television, there is no actualized dimension; it is only implied. The illusion is reinforced in many ways, but the prime device for simulating dimension is the technical convention of perspective. The effects produced by perspective can be enhanced by tonal manipulation through "chiaroscuro," the dramatic emphasis of light and shade. </p>

His modular unit, on which his entire system is based, is the size of man, and on this proportion, he establishes an average ceiling height, door size, window opening, et cetera. Everything becomes utilized and repeatable. Oddly enough, the unitized system of mass production has these effects built into it, and creative design solutions are often limited by what is available to design with, a limiting factor. </p>

In the proportion arrived at, a:b=c:a.

          				<h3>Human scale</h3>
						<p>The most vital factor in the establishment of scale is the measurement of man himself. In matters of design that relate to comfort and fit, all manufacture is geared to the average size of human proportion. There is an ideal proportion, a mean average, and all the endless variations that make us all unique. Mass production is, of course, rules by the mean average with all large objects of manufacture, such as cars and bathtubs, adapted to that measure. On the other hand, clothes have multiple sizes in mass production, recognizing the enormous variations in individual human size.</p>

          				<h3>What is real</h3>
						<p>Scale is often used in plans and maps to represent real measurement in proportion. The scale is usually designated, for example, 1 inch = 100 miles, or 1 inch = 10 miles. The globe of the world represents enormous distance in small measurement. All of which requires some extension of understanding to visualize in terms of distance real measurement as it is simulated in a map or plan. Measurement is an integral part of scale, but it is not crucial. What is critical is juxtaposition, what is alongside the visual subject, what setting it is in; these factors are more important.</p>

          				<h3>Scale</h3>
						<p>All visual elements have the capacity to modify and define each other. The process, itself, is the element of scale. Color is bright or subdued depending on juxtaposition, just as relative tonal values take on enormous visual modifications depending on what tone is next to or behind them. In other words, there can be no large without small. But even when large is established through small, the entire scale can be changed with the addition of another visual modification. Scale can be determined not only through relative size of visual clues but also through relationships to the field or the environment. The visible results concerning scale are fluid and not absolute since they are subject to so many variables of modification. All that is being observed is true in the context of scale.</p>

          				<h3>DO NOT TOUCH!</h3>
						<p>Texture has reference to the composition of a substance through minute variations on the surface material. Texture should serve as a sensitive and enriching experience. Unfortunately, those "DO NOT TOUCH! signs in the expensive shops overlap into social behavior, and we are strongly conditioned not to touch things or people with anything approximating sensual involvement. The result is a minimal tactile experience and even a fear of tactile contact; the sense of blind touch is carefully guarded in sighted people. We act super-cautiously when blindfolded or in the dark, reaching out tentatively, and, because of our limited experience of touch, we often do not recognize a texture. At the 1967 Montreal Expo, the 5+ Comingo Pavilion was designed for visitors to explore the quality of their five senses. It was a popular and enjoyable exhibit. People sniffed away at a series of funnels offering a variety of odors, even though they suspected, and justifiably, that some would be unpleasant. They listened, they looked, they tasted, but they stood hesitantly and inhibited in front of the yawning holes designed to be reached into blindly. What did they fear? it appears that the natural, free, "hands-on" investigative approach of the baby and a young child has been conditioned out of the adult by—Who knows what?—the Anglo-Saxon ethic, Puritan repression, instinctive taboos. Whatever the reason, the result starves one of our richest senses. But in this increasingly simulated and plastic world, the problem arises infrequently. Most of our textural experience is optical, not tactile. Not only is texture faked rather convincingly in plastics and printed material and faked fur, but, also, much of what we see that is painted, photographed, and filmed convincingly presents texture that is not there. If we ouch a photograph of silky velvet, we do not have the convincing tactile experience the visual clues promise. Meaning is based on what we see. This fakery is an essential factor in survival in nature; animals, birds, reptiles, insects, fish, take on the coloration and texture of their surroundings as a protection against predators. Man copies this camouflage method in war in response to the same needs for survival that inspires it in nature.</p>

          				<h3>Texture</h3>
						<p>Texture is the visual element that frequently serves as a stand-in for the qualities of another sense, touching. But in fact, we can appreciate and recognize texture either by touch or by sight individually, or by a combination of both. It is possible for a texture to have no tactile quality, only optical, like the lines of type on a printed page, or polka dots on material, or cross-hatched lines on a doodle. Where there is actual texture, the tactile and optical qualities coexist, not like tone and color which are unified, affording individual sensation to the eye and hand, even though we project onto both strong associative meaning. What sandpapers looks like and what sandpaper feels like have the same intellectual meaning, but not the same value. They are singular experiences which may or may not suggest each other under certain circumstances. The judgment of the eye is usually checked on by the hand by actual touching. Is it smooth or does it just look that way? Is that an indentation or a raised mark? No wonder there are so many " DO NOT TOUCH! signs. </p>

          				<h3>The force is strong</h3>
						<p>Since perception of color is the single most strongly emotional part of the visual process, it has great force and can be utilized to express and reinforce visual information to significant advantage. Color not only has universally shared meaning through experience, but it also has separate worth informationally through symbolically attached meaning. In addition to the highly negotiable color meaning, each of us has our own personal and subjective color preferences. We choose our own color statements and settings, but there is little analytic thought or concern about what methods or motivation we use to arrive at our own choices regarding the meaning and effect of color. When a jockey dons an owners silks, a soldier wears his dress uniform, and a nation displays its flag, the attempt to find symbolic meaning in their colors may be obvious. Not so in our personal color choices, which are less symbolic and therefore less clearly defined. Nevertheless, whether we think about it or not, realize it or not, we tell the world a great deal when we make a color choice.</p>

          				<h3>Complementary colors</h3>
						<p>There is another way of demonstrating this process. Two complementary colors displayed on the same middle tone of gray affect the neutral tone. The gray panel with a warm, red-orange hue appears bluish or cool, while the reverse occurs with the gray on which a blue-green square is displayed. Its gray background appears reddish-toned and warm. This experiment shows that the eye is seeing the opposite or contrasting hue, not just in the afterimage, but at the same time, it is viewing a color. The process is called "simultaneous contrast," and its psychophysiological significance extends beyond just its importance to color theory. It is another piece of evidence that indicated the intense need to reach for complete neutrality and hence complete repose that man demonstrates over and over again in the visual context.</p>

          				<h3>Afterimage</h3>
						<p>An afterimage is the physiological visual phenomenon that takes place after the human eye has been fixed or focused on any visual information. When the object or information being stared at is replaced with a blank white field, a negative image is seen on the blank space. The effect is related to the spots one sees after bright lights are directed into the eye. Although this is an extreme example, any image of color produces the complementary color or its exact opposite. It is on this visual phenomenon that Munsell based the entire structure of his color theory. The opposite color on his color wheel is what afterimage would be. There are further implications of what happens when you stare at a color long enough to produce an afterimage. You will first see the complementary color. For instance, if you stare at yellow, purple will appear on the blank area in your afterimage. Yellow is the closest hue to white or light; purple the closest to black or dark. The afterimage will not only be tonally darker than the value of yellow but will be the median tone of gray. A red of a middle tonal value would produce a complementary green of the same middle tone. The afterimage then appears to react in the same tonal fashion as the pigment. When you mix two complementary colors, red and green, yellow and purple, they not only can cancel out each other's chroma or hue to gray, they also produce from their mixture a middle tone of gray.  </p>

          				<h3>3rd dimension</h3>
						<p>The third, and last dimension of color is achromatic. It is the relative brightness, from light to dark, of value or tonal gradations. It must be noted, underlined, and emphasized that the presence or absence of color does not affect tone; it is a constant. A color television is an excellent device for demonstrating this visual fact. When you turn the color knobs slowly to black and white, to the monochromatic picture, you slowly drain off the color saturation. The process in no way affects the tonal value of the picture. Turning the saturation up and down demonstrates the constancy of tone and proves that color and tone coexist in perception without modifying each other. </p>

						<p>The second dimension of color is saturation, which is the relative purity of color from the hue to gray. Saturated color is pure, almost primitive, and always given preference by folk artists and children. It is both uncomplicated and overstated, composed of the primary and secondary hues. The less saturated colors reach toward neutrality of color, even noncolor, and are subtle and restful. The more intensely saturated the coloration of the visual object or event, the more highly charged it is with the expression and emotion—informational results in the choice of saturated or neutralized color based choice on intention. But saturation or its absence as a meaningful visual effect is the difference between the dentist's office and the Electric Circus.</p>

						<p>Color structure in its simplest formulation is taught through the color wheel. The primary colors, yellow, red, blue, and secondary colors, orange, green, violet, are invariably included in such a chart. However, it usually also includes expanded mixtures of at least twelve hues. From this simple chart of a color wheel, multiple variations of color hues can be developed.</p>

          				<h3>Three dimensions</h3>
						<p>Color has three dimensions which can be defined and measured. Hue is the color itself, or chroma, of which there are more than a hundred. Each hue has individual characteristics; group or categories of colors share common effects. There are three primary or elementary hues: yellow, red, blue. Each represents qualities that are fundamental. Yellow is the color considered closest to light and warmth; red is the most emotional and active; blue is passive and soft. Yellow and red tend to expand, blue contract. In association with each, through moxtures, new meanings take over. Red, which is a provoking hue, is subdued when it is mixed with blue and activated when it is combined with yellow. The same changes in effect are reached with yellow, which mellows when it is mixed with blue. </p>
