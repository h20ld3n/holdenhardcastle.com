          				<h3>TrueBlood Cookbook</h3>
          				<p>In order to surprise and delight their readers, Chronicle Books began converting their entire catalogue into digital or ebooks in 2010.</p>
          				<p>Aligning with the publisher's core values, the newly established ebooks team created a culture of education and experimentation. By allowing mistakes and happy accidents to happen, we discovered new ways to keep faithful to the original content.</p>

          				<h3>The Ultimate Metallica</h3>
          				<p>Working with outside vendors the Chronicle ebooks team established base styles and CSS. Thousands of InDesign files were sent for conversion. Based on guidelines and title-by-title specs, initial book conversions were delivered back to the group. The device agnostic content would be fine-tuned by embedding fonts, altering images, and adding other design elements.</p>
          				<p>High profile titles, authors, subject matter, and content required careful management and setting of expectations. The titles were revisited to discuss the original intentions of the authors and content.</p>

						<p> The letter E took a tumble and the only way to get her back on her foot is for people to stop using her. But who can take her place? The other letters have to make a decision ASAP. Z is too sleepy and Y asks way too many questions. Thankfully, O rolls in to try and save the day. Now E can rost up and got bottor...as long as ovorybody follows the rulos. Chock-full of verbal and visual puns, this zany book is sure to tickle both the brain and the funny bone.</p>
