          				<h3>As an artist, no matter what the medium, are we responsible for the original work and for the adapted work, and where do these responsibilities end for the artist?</h3>
          				<p>In 2006, I wrote and directed a short film, "Leader of the Pack," based on the 1950s song by the Shangri-Las. I also began adapting "Boyz 'R' Us," a novel for young readership published by Random House Australia and written by Scott Monk, into a feature-length screenplay. Issues of loyalty to the original work, moral responsibility to the audience in delivering the idea presented themselves during the creation of "Leader of the Pack" and while "Boyz 'R' Us."</p>
                        <h3>Boyz 'R' Us And Its Context</h3>
                        <p>"Boyz 'R' Us" does not exist in a vacuum and certainly would not be the first film of its kind. It is, however, my first attempt at adapting a major written work into something suitable for the screen.  At its core, "Boyz 'R' Us" is a coming of age story.</p>
                        <p>com&#xb7;ing&#xb7;of&#xb7;age&#xb7;stor&#xb7;y (n) - A series of events affects a small and particular group of people, where a life-changing event occurs and is unable or unwilling to return to the previous state; the change is not limited to the characters in the movie.</p>
                        <p>While there are many coming of age movies, "Boyz 'R' Us" potentially exists with films like my own short "Leader of the Pack," "City of God," "Kids," "Chopper," and "Somersault." While these films are very different from each other, there are similarities between them and "Boyz 'R' Us." The films relate to and should be an inspiration for "Boyz 'R' Us" in delivery and message. The films also show the potential for success of "Boyz 'R' Us."</p>
                        <p>"Leader of the Pack" is a short film based on the Shangri-Las 1950s pop song of the same name. The film looks at and plays with the relationships between friends and family. The film has been updated for the 21st century but remains true to the original story. The kids care about very little except maybe one another. If only briefly, the film touches on the insecurities of youth, the materialism of our culture, and yes, the fact that kids are kids and do stupid juvenile things.</p>
                        <p>When I first set out writing "Leader of the Pack," it was not "Leader of the Pack." I didn't know what it was. But it had to be about kids, and I wanted the kids to be authentic. I had all sorts of situations and bits and pieces of dialogue ready to go, but I needed a story. The 1950's song "Leader of the Pack" came blaring out of the crappy portable speakers I own. Here was a song that had it all. My inspiration arrived via iPod. The first draft quickly began to take shape. The period seemed to be a big issue. When and where to place the story?</p>
                        <h3>Adapting, updating, and modernizing the story best suited the original idea.</h3>
                        <p>"Leader of the Pack" my first attempt at an adaptation, but it was also a first attempt at doing something longer than ten minutes. After completing the screenplay for "Leader of the Pack," I wanted to do something more. Because of the age of the characters, the subject matter, and themesâ€”"Boyz 'R' Us" was the long-form project I had been looking for.</p>
                        <p>Based on Scott Monk's book, "Boyz 'R' Us" is a coming of age story that follows seventeen-year-old Mitch as he struggles to deal with loyalties to his friends, come to terms with who he is, and facing his past. In publicity material for the novel, "Boyz 'R' Us" is described as a long mad ride. Chicks, music, bored kids, fathers that suck on the bottle to put themselves to sleep next to a mindlessly blaring TV set. Mitch is scared. His past won't let go. His would-be friends are enemies. His would-be father is a drunk. His only support comes from his brother and newfound fellow outcast.</p>

                        <h3>City of God</h3>
                        <p>The 2003 Miramax film "City of God," written by Braulino Mantovani and directed by Fernando Meirelles, based on actual events and the novel by Paolo Lin, is a coming of age story about a group of kids who struggle in the Brazilian ghetto. The film has been described as "dazzling."<sup>1</sup> It's "exploration of life in the gun-crazy, drug-addled Brazilian-slums. It is unflinchingly honest. The movie follows the children of Cidade de Deus as they struggle with childhood "devoid of fathers or hope, guns replace toys and drugs" are "the main currency of power."<sup>1</sup> "The violence...is extreme and shocking, even though there is virtually no blood. Part of the reason has to do with the age of the killers and their victims. Gang members are children. They kill and are killed with the same callousness as adults. Death is no respecter of age in the slums of Rio de Janeiro. The immediate goal of a seven-year-old homeless boy is not finding a family or a friend, but finding a gun." When "war...is declared, children are quick to declare their allegiance so they can obtain a weapon and go out to kill".<sup>2</sup> Children murder other children and later adults as they gain power and continue the cycle.</p>

                        <p>"City Of God" has many of the same character types and storylines as "Boyz 'R' Us." The level of violence that occurs without showing any blood makes "City Of God" an excellent source of comparison and inspiration for the type of movie that "Boyz 'R' Us" should be. The lack of bloodshed on-screen made the film a little difficult to view. When watching the movie for the first time, the editing and shooting style of the film allowed my imagination to get the better of me. By not showing anything, the story is more impactful and engages the audience.</p>

                    <h3>Kids</h3>
                        <p>The 1995 Independent Pictures and Guys Upstairs film "Kids," written by Harmony Korine and directed by Larry Clark, depicts a stark world of skateboard-soaring, morally impaired teenagers in New York City whose parents are practically nonexistent, whose sexual activities are devoid of human concern, and whose thoughts of the future reach no further than to the night ahead.<sup>3</sup> The story follows a group of teenage boys and girls through one day and night, during which they travel Manhattan on skateboards and subway trains, have sex, drink, use drugs, talk, party, and crash in a familiar stupor, before starting all over again the next day. The movie sees this culture in such flat, unblinking detail that it feels like a documentary; it knows what it's talking about.<sup>4</sup></p>

While he is trying to escape this potential world, he is drawn to it. It's part of his past, and it's a past he is having trouble letting go of. The characters in "Kids" are uncaring and are only after the next thrill and underage fuck. While at this point, the kids in "Boyz 'R' Us" are not this brutal, they crave that level of excitement in their lives. The next generation of kids in "Boyz 'R' Us" wants so badly to be part of the world of "Kids." When and if they get, there is entirely up to them.</p>

                        <h3>Chopper</h3>
                        <p>"Chopper," the 2001 joint venture of Pariah, Mushroom Pictures, Cherub Pictures, and Films Finance Corporation Australia, written and directed by Andrew Dominik, is based on the experiences and universe of, and as described in Mark "Chopper" Read's book "From the Inside." His universe consists of "black teeth, paranoia, and no ears".<sup>5</sup>  "Chopper is twisted around the wrong way. His friends are his enemies. His crimes are his achievements. The price on his head measures his worth. He claims that 'drugs ruined the criminal world,' but he enjoys a little speed up the snout..." He repeatedly stabs men, showing eerie remorse. "Fuck, shit, are you OK? Are you alright?" Holding their necks together, dying in a pool of blood, Chopper asks whether they'd like a cigarette. "Quite the gentlemen." The film "jeopardizes the viewer's sense of security and challenges values set" by Australian society.<sup>6</sup></p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Without the violence or brutality, the film would ring untrue, turn into an after-school special, and completely miss its target audience. "Chopper," while violent, has a humor to it. The unbelievable events that may or may not be embellished make ninety percent of the film bearable. The last five to ten minutes of the film bring the whole story together. Chopper sits alone in his gaol cell, watching himself on television. Chopper ends up alone because of the life he chose. </p>
                        <p>Because of how the violence is depicted in "Chopper," the message is often lost. You see everything. You become desensitized to the violence. "City of God" does a much better job of depicting the violence by not actually showing it. The violence is much more powerful when left up to the imagination of the audience.  To reach the young audience, "Boyz 'R' Us" needs to draw inspiration from films like "City of God," which show less and leave the violence up to the imagination. The use of humor or light relief in "Chopper" should also influence "Boyz 'R' Us."</p>

                        <h3>Somersault</h3>
                        <p>The 2006 Magnolia Pictures film "Somersault," written and directed by Cate Shortland, is a "visually haunting coming-of-age tale".<sup>7</sup> "16-year-old Heidi...runs away from home after being caught making out with her mother's boyfriend. She ends up in an off-season ski resort, seeking love from anyone who will give it to her. Heidi strives for intimacy by indulging in a string of sexual encounters that skirt on the edge of danger". "Bereft of love and real affection; she seeks the tenderness missing in her life through a series of brief erotic encounters. When she meets Joe, the son of a local landowner, the sparks fly. Momentarily, Heidi appears to have found salvation. But he, too, flounders when poised to make a deeper emotional commitment. The rejection propels the troubled adolescent to revert to her promiscuous ways. Yet amidst the ice and snow, she finds a supportive anchor in local hotelier, Irene, whose staunch love and loyalty to her imprisoned son points the troubled adolescent ever so slightly in the direction of redemption".<sup>8</sup></p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>The character struggles in "Chopper" and "City Of God" are external. In "Somersault," Heidi goes through the same internal battles as Mitch does in "Boyz 'R' Us." It's disturbing to see the young girl struggle with her age, being an outcast, and the innocence she possesses. She feels alone and isolated in the world and is looking for someone, anyone, to understand and accept her. Heidi constantly puts herself into situations with other people that have an understanding of the world, and she craves their attention. Heidi's major flaw is that she cannot handle being ignored or not being the focus. As with most teenagers, at some point in their lives, there is no middle ground. She doesn't have a moral grounding. She is just a confused kid who cuts and runs every time something goes wrong. In "Boyz 'R' Us," Mitch has just discovered his moral grounding but is struggling with who he is and letting go of his past and innocence.</p>
                        <p>When adapting "Leader of the Pack, the story and message of the original song simply became a base for characters and situations to live. Mark "Chopper" Read may or may not have taken liberties with stories in his autobiography. I would guess that most people adapt the stories they tell to make them more interesting. They are leaving out all the boring in-between bits and the minor details. When creating the first draft of "Boyz 'R' Us" the story and text needed to be adapted to reach the target audience and deliver a message. But what does adaptation mean to critics, my target audience, and me? </p>
