          				<p>I would like to acknowledge Charlie Strachan for his time and patience, Jane Oliver Lange, Helen Cunningham, and Tin Pang for allowing me to vent my frustrations and the entire cast and crew of "Leader Of The Pack," who have all assisted me in my many pursuits.</p>

          				<h3>As an artist, no matter what the medium, are we responsible for the original work and for the adapted work, and where do these responsibilities end for the artist?</h3>
          				<p>During 2006, I wrote and directed a short film, Leader of the Pack" based on the 1950s song by the Shangri-Las. I also began adapting "Boyz-R-Us," a novel for young readership published by Random House Australia and written by Scott Monk, into a feature-length screenplay. Issues of loyalty to the original work, moral responsibility to the audience in delivering the idea presented themselves during the creation of "Leader of the Pack" and while adapting "Boyz-R-Us."</p>
