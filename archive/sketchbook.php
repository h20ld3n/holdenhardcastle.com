          				<h3>Univers</h3>
						<p>The font family Univers is one of the greatest typographic achievements of the second half of the 20th century. The family has the advantage of having a variety of weights and styles, which, even when combined, give an impression of steadiness and homogeneity. The clear, objective forms of Univers make this a legible font suitable for almost any typographic need. In 1954 the French type foundry Deberny &amp; Peignot wanted to add a linear sans serif type in several weights to the range of the Lumitype fonts. Adrian Frutiger, the foundry's art director, suggested refraining from adapting an existing alphabet. He wanted to instead make a new font that would, above all, be suitable for the typesetting of longer textsâ€”quite an exciting challenge for a sans-serif font at that time. Starting with his old sketches from his student days at the School for the Applied Arts in Zurich, he created the Univers type family. In 1957, the family was released by Deberny &amp; Piegnot, and afterwards, it was produced by Linotype. The Deberny &amp; Peignot type library was acquired in 1972 by Haas, and the Haas'sche Schriftgiesserei (Haas Type Foundry) was folded into the D. Stempel AG/Linotype collection in 1985/1989. Adrian Frutiger continues to do design work with Linotype right up to the present day. In 1997, Frutiger and the design staff at Linotype completed a large joint project of completely re-designing and updating the Univers family. The result: Univers Next - available with 59 weights and four Linotype Univers Typewriter weights. With its sturdy, clean forms Univers can facilitate an expression of cool elegance and rational competence.</p>
						<p>Univers has the uncanny ability to combine well with fonts of many different styles and origins:</p>
						<p>Old style fonts such as: Janson Text, Meridien, Sabon, Wilke.</p>
						<p>Modern-stressed fonts such as: Linotype Centennial, Walbaum.</p>
						<p>Slab serif fonts such as Egyptienne F, Serifa.</p>
						<p>Script and brush fonts such as: Brush Script, Mistral, Ruling Script.</p>
						<p>Blackletter fonts such as: Duc De Berry, Grace, San Marco.</p>
						<p>Even fun fonts such as F2F OCRAlexczyk, Linotype Red Babe, Linotype Seven."</p>

          				<h3>Bodoni</h3>
						<p>Giambattista Bodoni (1740-1813) was called the King of Printers; he was a prolific type designer, a masterful engraver of punches and the most widely admired printer of his time. His books and typefaces were created during the 45 years he was the director of the fine press and publishing house of the Duke of Parma in Italy. He produced the best of what are known as modern" style types, basing them on the finest writing of his time. Modern types represented the ultimate typographic development of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. They have characteristics quite different from the types that preceded them; such as extreme vertical stress, fine hairlines contrasted by bold main strokes, and very subtle, almost non-existent bracketing of sharply defined hairline serifs. Bodoni saw this style as beautiful and harmonious-the natural result of writing done with a well-cut pen, and the look was fashionable and admired. Other punchcutters, such as the Didot family (1689-1853) in France, and J. E. Walbaum (1768-1839) in Germany made their own versions of the modern faces. Even though some nineteenth century critics turned up their noses and called such types shattering and chilly, today the Bodoni moderns are seen in much the same light as they were in his own time. When used with care, the Bodoni types are both romantic and elegant, with a presence that adds tasteful sparkle to headlines and advertising.</p>

          				<h3>New Baskerville</h3>
						<p>John Baskerville (1706-1775) was an accomplished writing master and printer from Birmingham, England. He was the designer of several types, punchcut by John Handy, which are the basis for the fonts that bear the name Baskerville today. The excellent quality of his printing influenced such famous printers as Didot in France and Bodoni in Italy. Though he was known internationally as an innovator of technique and style, his high standards for paper and ink quality made it difficult for him to compete with local commercial printers. However, his fellow Englishmen imitated his types, and in 1768, Isaac Moore punchcut a version of Baskerville's letterforms for the Fry Foundry. Baskerville produced a masterpiece folio Bible for Cambridge University, and today, his types are considered to be fine representations of eighteenth century rationalism and neoclassicism. Legible and eminently dignified, Baskerville makes an excellent text typeface; and its sharp, high-contrast forms make it suitable for elegant advertising pieces as well.</p>

						<p><strong>Get back in the game.</strong> Within every man is the heart of an athlete. Rediscover yours.</p>
						<p>At some point, many a fortysomething guy has come to the same delusion: His glory days in athletics are behind him. "It's the greatest falsehoo of aging," says Mark Verstegen, president of Athletes' Performance, in Tempe Arizona. "At the age of 40, much of a man's athletic potential has simply been locked down by the sacrifices he has made to climb the ladder of success." The key to turning back the clock is to focus on excercises that build not only strength and power, but also muscular symmetry, coordination, and stability.</p>

          				<h3>Modular relationships</h3>
						<p>A <i>module</i> is a basic elementary unit that can be combined and repeated to become the basis for the whole. The physical world with its molecular and crystal structure, all life with its cellular structure, and much art and design are based on modular relationships. The most frequent use of modular structure in a graphic design is the use of a modular grid of horizontal and vertical linear divisions. A grid structure can take many forms: a regular sequence of squares or rectangels; a format of columns for publication design; and complex modular relationships that allow for diverse typographic treatments and a lage variety of image sizes and shapes.</p>
						<p>A <i>visual program</i> is a system of parameters used consistently to unify a series or sequence of designs. Grid structure, consistent use of type sizes and styles, placment of page numbers, and a color plan are factors that might beincluded. Russion constructivist designers of the 1920s made important contributions to the development of visual programs. The trilingual 1925 book, <i>The Ism of Art</i>, designed by El Lissitzky is a milestone in the use of a modular grid structure and mathematical measurement to bring order to complex visual material. Lissitzky carefully planned a visual program that gives order and consistent graphic properties. The book is organized into two sections: an eleven-page typographic section, followed by a fort-eight page pictorial portfolio presenting major European art movements from 1914 until 1924.</p>
						<p>Lissitzky executed his layouts on graph paper, which imposed the order of modular structure into his work. He specified san serif type, for he and other members of the mondern movement believe that it best expressed the rationalism of the scientific and technological era. Pictorial portfolio pages are anchored by heavy black rules in their top outside corners, adjacent to the name of the movement. Page numbers align with the outside vertical grid line. Visual continuity and immediate identification results, for readers quickly learn to look at the outside top corner for this information. By stripping away their backgrounds to silhoutte many of the photographs, Lissitzky gives them a strong "object quality." Picture numbers are large, which makes them concrete from in the design orginization. These numbers are composed in counterpoint to the illustrations. Lissitzky makes generous use of white space as an important compositional element.</p>

          				<h3>The illustrative grid</h3>
						<p>Another approach to the use of grids involves grid imagery as non-functional subject matter. The grid becomes an illustrative element rather than a functional skeleton. The grid becomes visible and conveys structure on itself. A stong association with planning, building, technology, architecture, and science is often implied.</p>
						<p>Postion of the grid is determined through a sense of pictorial space. Structure is incidental. Elements are placed inuitively.</p>

          				<h3>Interrupted grid</h3>
						<p>An effective technique for adding variety to grid layout and composition is to interrupt the grid. Interruption may be quite subtle or very dramatic. Use interruption for emphasis or to focus attention on a specific part of the layout.</p>
						<p>Thie technique is most effective when repetitive elements are necessary. interruption can happen with photos, text type, headlines, or color blocks.</p>

						<p>Angled grids offer relief from the familiar orientation of information.</p>
						<p>Inclined grids can push some units off the page that can be disregarded or used to bleed select photos.</p>
						<p>Keep the angle of inclination consistent. Information reading on an upward tilt is percieved more positively than tilting downward. The inclined grid is more effective for simple posters, flyers, and brochures than longer annual reports, magazines, or books. Inclined layouts have dynamic potential. Spaces tend to be unequal in volume. Incline helps exaggerate asymmetry.</p>

						<p>Lines with a length of 10-12 words are the most readable. Shorter lines are also effective. Extremely long lines decrease readability.</p>
						<p>Decide column length from margin requirements. It should be an exact number of lines. Cap height of the first line will determine the top of the column. Base line of the last line will determine the bottom of the column. Type density (greyness) relates to typeface and degree of linespacing.</p>
						<p>Experiment with margins to alter the look of grid layouts. margins are arbitrary. Unequal margins offer great design potential as do unusually wide margins. Bleed the grid or butt it to an edge for impact.</p>

          				<h3>Using grids</h3>
						<p>It is important to understand that even the well conceived grid, accurately drafted, will not insure effective design. The gird can only provide logical positions for placing visual material, nothing more. Designers must use the grid creatively to maximize communications potential. "Where should I put it?" is a questions that grids can help answer.</p>

          				<h3>Grid size</h3>
						<p>A strong reason for using a grid is to provide perceptual organization for an audience. When choosing the of number grid units beware of too many or too few. Designers can not communicate effectively above or below the perceptual limits of the audience. Viewers must be able to decipher a grid and sense its coherence to be comfortable. two or three grids per panel are too few modules. 72 or 124 are too many, as the audience has great difficulty sorting out the organization. The more grid modules and intersections, the more the layout positions exist for the designer. However, small grid units are difficult to construct, impede decision making and are not comfortable to the audience. The goal then is to adjust content to the number of grid units within a zone of perceptual acuity. Challenge the audience visually, but don't completely remove the the clues to the grid.</p>

          				<h3>Asymmetic composition</h3>
						<p>Designers oftern need to organize information in situations where there is not a logical opportunity for a symmetrical compisition. Symmetry is a situation where, (as in human physiology) elements are balanced based ona center line. The composition of one side is identical (but reversed) to another. Whiel this a is a good system, all situations do not lend themselves to a symmetrical order. Asymmetry is a balanced ordering of elements where one side of the composition does not mirror the other. An additional advantage of asymmetric compositions is that they have a tendency to be more dynamic that symmetric compositions.</p>
						<p>Dynamic compositions refers to a situation where the visual elements imply motion. The term dynamic is in contrast to the term staticm as situation where the elements appear ina fixed position.</p>

						<p>Designers often face the problem of organizing diverse visual elements on a plane. It is necessary to determine a rational structural system toward this end. One standard system used by designers is the grid. The grid provides an objective armature for organizing a visual composition.</p>
