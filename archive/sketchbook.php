          				<h3>Just a theory</h3>
						<p>There are many color theories. Color, both the color of light and the color of pigment, behaves in unique ways, but our knowledge of color in visual communication goes a little further than collecting observations of our reactions to it. There is no single, ultimate system of how hues relate to each other. </p>

          				<h3>Color</h3>
						<p>The monochromatic representations we so readily accept in the visual media are tonal stand-ins for color, for what is, in truth, a chromatic world, our richly colored universe. While tone is related to questions of survival and is therefore essential to the human organism, color has a stronger affinity to emotions. It is possible to think of color as the aesthetic frosting on the cake, rich, and in many ways useful, but not absolutely necessary for creating visual messages. That would be a very shallow view of the matter. Color is loaded with information and one of the pervasive visual experience we all have in common. It is, therefore, an invaluable source of visual communicators. In the environment, we share the associative meanings of the color of trees, grass, sky, earth and on endlessly to where we see color as a common stimulus. And there, we associate meaning. We know color also under a broad category of symbolic meaning. Red means something, for instance, even where it does not have any environmental connection. The red that is associated with anger has been carried over in the 'red flag (or cape) waved in front of a bull." The color red has little significance for the bull, who has no sensitivity to the color but only to the fact that the cape or flag moves. Red means danger, and love, and warmth, and life, and maybe a hundred other things. Each color has as many meanings, associative and symbolic; thus, color offers an enormous vocabulary of great usefulness in visual literacy. The variety of meaning obtainable is expressed from Carl Sanburg's poem, "The People, Yes":</p>
						<p style="text-align: center">The blood of all men of all nations being red the Communist International named red its banner color<br style="display: block">
							Pop Innocent IV gave cardinals their first red hats saying a cardinal's blood belonged to the holy mother church.<br style="display: block">
							The bloodcolor red is a symbol</p>

          				<h3>Dimensions</h3>
						<p>Lightness and darkness are so intensely important to the perception of our environment that we accept a monochromatic representation of reality in the visual arts and we do it without hesitation. In Fact, the varying tones of gray in photographs, film, television, etching, mezzotints, tonal sketches, are monochromatic surrogates and represent a world that does not exist, a visual world we accept only because of the dominance of tonal values in our perceptions. The ease with which we accept the monochromatic visual representation is the exact measure of just how vitally important tone is to us, and even more interesting, just how unconsciously sensitive we are to the dull, monochromatic values of our environment. How many people even realize they have this sensitivity? The reason for this startling visual fact is that tonal sensitivity is essential to our survival. It is second only to the vertical-horizontal reference as visual clues to our relationship to our surroundings. Through it, we see sudden movement, depth, distance, and other environmental references. Tonal value is another way of describing light. Through it, and only through it, we see.</p>

          				<h3>Dimensions</h3>
						<p>The world we live in is dimensional, and tone is one of the visualizer's best tools for indicating and expressing that dimension. Perspective is the method for plotting many of the special effects in our natural surroundings, to represent the three-dimensional way we see in two-dimensional graphic form. It uses many devices to plot distance, bulk, point of view, the vanishing point, the horizon line, eye level, et cetera. But even with the aid of perspective, line alone will not create the illusion of reality effectively without the assistance of tone. The addition of tonal background detail reinforced the appearance of reality through the sensation of reflected light and cast shadows. The effect is even more dramatic in simple, basic shaped such as the circle, which could not appear as dimensional without tonal information.</p>

          				<h3>From dark to light</h3>
						<p>In nature there are multiple subtle steps which, in man's means for reproduction of nature in art and film, are severely limited. When we observe tonality in nature, we see true light. When we talk of tonality in graphics, paintings, photography, film, we have reference to some pigment, paint, or nitrate of silver, which is used to simulate natural tone. Between light and dark in nature, there are hundreds of distinct tonal steps, but in graphic arts and photography, these steps are severely limited. From white to black in pigment, the most commonly used tonal scale has about thirty steps. At the Bauhaus and many other art schools, students have always been challenged to see how many distinct and recognizable tonal steps they could represent from black to white. With great sensitivity and delicacy, they can be pushed to 30+ tones of gray, but this is not practical for common use since it is too subtle visually. How, then, can the visualizer cope with this tonal limitation? Manipulation of tone through juxtaposition greatly lessons the tonal limitation inherent in the problem of emulating the tonal largess of nature. One tone of gray can change dramatically when it is placed on a tonal scale. The possibility for highly expanded tonal representation can be achieved through utilization of these means. </p>

          				<h3>Tone</h3>
						<p>The edges that line used to represent in a rough sketch or a detailed, mechanical plan in the environment, for the most part, appear as the juxtaposition of tone, the intensity of darkness or lightness of anything seen. We see because of the relative presence or absence of light, but light is not uniformly shed on the environment either by the sun or moon or by artificial light. If it were, we would be as much in the dark as we are in complete absence of light. Light goes around things, is reflected by shiny surfaces, falls on objects which themselves have relative lightness and darkness. Variations in light or tone are the means by which we optically distinguish the complicated visual information in the environment. In other words, we see what is dark because it abuts or overlaps what is light, and vice-versa.</p>

          				<h3>Direction</h3>
						<p>Every basic shape expresses three basic and meaningful visual directions: the square, the horizontal and vertical; the triangle, diagonal; the circle, the curve. Each of the visual directions has strong associative meaning and is a valuable tool in making visual messages. The horizontal-vertical is man's primary reference in terms of his well-being and maneuverability. Its most basic meaning has to do not only with the human organism's relationship to the environment but also to stability in all visual matters. Not only does man have more ease in balance; so do all things constructed and designed. Diagonal direction has particular significance in direct reference to the idea of stability. It is the opposite formulation, the most unstable directional force and consequently the most provoking visual formulation. Its meaning is threatening and almost literally upsetting. Curved directional forces have meanings associated with encompassment, repetition, and warmth. All directional forces have great importance to compositional intention toward final effect and purpose. </p>

						<p>All the basic shapes are fundamental, simple planar figures, which can be easily described and constructed either visually or verbally. A square is a four-sided figure with exact equal right angles at each corner and sides of exactly the same length. A circle is a continuously curved figure whose outline is at all points equidistant from its center. An equilateral triangle is a three-sided figure whose angles and sides are all equal. From these basic shapes in endless combinations and variations, we derive all physical forms in nature and in the imagination of man.</p>

						<p>Line can take many different forms to express many different moods. It can be very loose and undisciplined, as in sketches, to take advantage of it spontaneity of expression. It can be very delicate and undulating or bold and coarse, even in the hands of the same artist. It can be hesitant, indecisive, questioning, when it is merely a visual probe toward design. It can also be as personal as a handwriting in the form of nervous doodles, which are a hallmark of the unconscious activity under pressure thinking or as amusement in boredom. Even in the bloodless, mechanical format of maps, plans for a house, cogs in a machine, line expresses the intention of the maker and artist, and further, personal feelings and emotions, and most important, vision.</p>

						<p>Line is also a tool for notation systems, writing, for example. Writing, map-making, electric symbols, and music are all examples of symbol systems in which line is the most important element. But in art, line is the essential element of drawing,  which is a notation system that does not stand for something else, symbolically, but does capsulize visual information, boiling it down to a state of reduction where all superfluous information has been stripped away and only the essential remains. This spareness has a highly dramatic effect in drawing or dry points, woodcuts, etching, and lithographs. </p>

          				<h3>The visual arts</h3>
						<p>A line, because of its nature, has enormous energy. It is never static; it is the restless, probing, visual elements of the sketch. Line, whenever it is employed, is the essential tool of pre-visualization, the means for presenting in palpable form that which does not exist yet, except in the imagination. In this way, it is tremendously useful to the visual process. Its fluid linear quality contributes to the freedom of experimentation. Yet for all its looseness and freedom, line is not vague: it is decisive; it has direction and purpose, it is going somewhere, it is doing some definitive. Thus, line can also be tight and technical, serving as the prime event in diagrammatic plans for mechanical construction and architecture and many other highly measured or scaled visual representations. Whether it is used loosely and experimentally or tightly and measured, line is the indispensable means for making visible what cannot be see, what does not exist except in the imagination. </p>

          				<h3>The Line</h3>
						<p>When the dots are so close to one another that they cannot be individually recognized, the sensation of direction is increased, and the chain of dots becomes another distinctive visual element, a line. A line could also be defined as a dot in motion, or the history of a dot's movement, since, when we make a continuous mark or a line we make it by placing a marker point on a surface and moving it along, leaving the formed marks as a record.</p>

          				<h3>Connecting the dots</h3>
						<p>When seen, dots connect and therefore are capable of leading the eye. In great profusion and juxtaposed, dots create the illusion of tone or color, which, as already noted, is the visual fact on which mechanical means for reproducing and continuous tone is based. The perceptual phenomenon of visual fusion was explored bt Seurat in his Pointillist paintings, which are remarkably varied in color and tone, although he used only four pots of paint—yellow, red, blue, and black—and applied the paint with tiny, pointed brushes. All the Impressionists explored the process of blending, contrasting, and organizing, which took place in the eyes of the viewer. Involving and exciting, the process was in some ways similar to some of the more recent theories of McLuhan concerning visual involvement and participation in the act of seeing as a part of the meaning. But no one probed the possibilities as completely as Seurat, who, in his efforts, seems to have anticipated four-color halftone process by which almost all full-color continuos-tone photographs and drawings are not reproduced in mass printing.</p>
						<p>The unique ability of a series of dots to lead the eye is intensified the closer the dots are to one another.</p>

          				<h3>The dot</h3>
						<p>The dot is the simplest, irreducibly minimum unit of visual communication. In nature, roundness is the most common formulation, the straight or square in the natural state being a rarity. When any liquid material is dropped on a surface, it assumes a rounded form, even if it does not simulate a perfect dot. When we make a mark, whether with color of heavy substance or with a stick, we think of that visual element asa dat that can serve as a reference point or a marker of space. Any point has a strong visual power to attract the eye wherever it exists naturally or is placed by man in response to a purpose.</p>

          				<h3>A note</h3>
						<p>It is vital to note that the choice of emphasis of visual elements, the manipulation of those elements toward and intended effect, lies in the hands of the artist and craftsman and designer; they are the visualizer. What they choose to do with them is their art and craft, and the choices are infinite. The simplest visual elements can be used with great complexity of intention; the dot juxtaposed in varying sizes is the integral element of the halftone print and plate (cut), which is the mechanical means of mass reproduction of continuous tone visual material, particularly photographs; at the same tim, the photograph, whose character it is to report the environment in exact detail, can become a simplifying and abstract medium in the hands of a master photographer.  like Aaron Siskind. Deeper understanding of the elemental construction of visual forms offers the visualizer greater freedom and options in composition; those options are essential to the visual communicator.</p>
						<p>To analyze and understand the total structure of the a visual language, it is help to focus on the individual visual elements, one at a time, so as to better understand their unique qualities. </p>

          				<h3>Trompe l'oeil</h3>
						<p>Using basic visual components as a means for knowledge and understanding of either complete categories of visual media or individual works is an excellent method for exploration of their potential and relized success in expression. Dimension, for instance, exists as a visual element in architecture and sculpture and in both these media is a dominant in relation to other visual elements. The whole science and art of perspective was developed during the Renaissance to suggest the presence of dimension in two dimensional visual work such as painting and drawing. Even the trompe l'oeil aid of perspective, dimension in these visual forms can only be implied, not expressed. But nowhere is dimension more subtly and completely synthesized than in film, still and moving. The lens sees as the eye sees in complete detail, fully reinforced with all of the visual elements. All of which is another way of saying the visual elements are richly present in our natural environment. No such completeness of replication of out visual setting is present in the beginning of visual ideas, the plan, the rough sketch. Previsualization is dominated by the simple, spare, yet highly expressive element of line.</p>

          				<h3>Gestalt elements</h3>
						<p>Much of what we know about the interaction and effect of human perception on visual meaning is drawn from the research and experimentation in Gestalt phychology, but Gestalt thinking has more to offer than just the relationship between psychophysiological phenomena and visual expression. Its theoretical base is the belief that an approach to understanding and analyzing all systems requires recognizing that the system (or object or event, et cetera) as a whole is made up of interacting parts, which can be isolated and viewed as completely independent and then reassembled into the whole. No one unit of the system can be changed without modifying the whole. Any visual event or work is an incomparable example of this thesis since it was originally devised to exist as a well-balanced and inextricably involved totality. You can analyze any visual work from many points of view; one of the most revealing is to break it down into its constituent elements to better understand the whole. This process can provide deep insight into the nature of any visual medium as well as that of the individual work and the previsualization and making of a visual statment as well as the interpretation and response to it.</p>

          				<h3>Visual elements</h3>
						<p>Whenever anything is designed and made, sketched and painted, drawn, scratched, constructed, sculpted, or gestured, the visual substance of the work is composed from a basic list of elements. Visual elements are not to be confused with the materials or the medium, the wood or clay or paint or film. The visual elments are the basic substance of what we see, and they are few in number: the dot, line, shape, direction, tone, color, texture, dimension, scale, movement. Few though they may be, they comprise the raw material of all visual information in selective choices and combinations. The structure of the visual work is the force that determines which visual elements are present and with what emphasis.</p>

          				<h3>Univers</h3>
						<p>The font family Univers is one of the greatest typographic achievements of the second half of the 20th century. The family has the advantage of having a variety of weights and styles, which, even when combined, give an impression of steadiness and homogeneity. The clear, objective forms of Univers make this a legible font suitable for almost any typographic need. In 1954 the French type foundry Deberny &amp; Peignot wanted to add a linear sans serif type in several weights to the range of the Lumitype fonts. Adrian Frutiger, the foundry's art director, suggested refraining from adapting an existing alphabet. He wanted to instead make a new font that would, above all, be suitable for the typesetting of longer texts—quite an exciting challenge for a sans-serif font at that time. Starting with his old sketches from his student days at the School for the Applied Arts in Zurich, he created the Univers type family. In 1957, the family was released by Deberny &amp; Piegnot, and afterwards, it was produced by Linotype. The Deberny &amp; Peignot type library was acquired in 1972 by Haas, and the Haas'sche Schriftgiesserei (Haas Type Foundry) was folded into the D. Stempel AG/Linotype collection in 1985/1989. Adrian Frutiger continues to do design work with Linotype right up to the present day. In 1997, Frutiger and the design staff at Linotype completed a large joint project of completely re-designing and updating the Univers family. The result: Univers Next - available with 59 weights and four Linotype Univers Typewriter weights. With its sturdy, clean forms Univers can facilitate an expression of cool elegance and rational competence.</p>
						<p>Univers has the uncanny ability to combine well with fonts of many different styles and origins:</p>
						<p>Old style fonts such as: Janson Text, Meridien, Sabon, Wilke.</p>
						<p>Modern-stressed fonts such as: Linotype Centennial, Walbaum.</p>
						<p>Slab serif fonts such as Egyptienne F, Serifa.</p>
						<p>Script and brush fonts such as: Brush Script, Mistral, Ruling Script.</p>
						<p>Blackletter fonts such as: Duc De Berry, Grace, San Marco.</p>
						<p>Even fun fonts such as F2F OCRAlexczyk, Linotype Red Babe, Linotype Seven."</p>

          				<h3>Bodoni</h3>
						<p>Giambattista Bodoni (1740-1813) was called the King of Printers; he was a prolific type designer, a masterful engraver of punches and the most widely admired printer of his time. His books and typefaces were created during the 45 years he was the director of the fine press and publishing house of the Duke of Parma in Italy. He produced the best of what are known as modern" style types, basing them on the finest writing of his time. Modern types represented the ultimate typographic development of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. They have characteristics quite different from the types that preceded them; such as extreme vertical stress, fine hairlines contrasted by bold main strokes, and very subtle, almost non-existent bracketing of sharply defined hairline serifs. Bodoni saw this style as beautiful and harmonious-the natural result of writing done with a well-cut pen, and the look was fashionable and admired. Other punchcutters, such as the Didot family (1689-1853) in France, and J. E. Walbaum (1768-1839) in Germany made their own versions of the modern faces. Even though some nineteenth century critics turned up their noses and called such types shattering and chilly, today the Bodoni moderns are seen in much the same light as they were in his own time. When used with care, the Bodoni types are both romantic and elegant, with a presence that adds tasteful sparkle to headlines and advertising.</p>

          				<h3>New Baskerville</h3>
						<p>John Baskerville (1706-1775) was an accomplished writing master and printer from Birmingham, England. He was the designer of several types, punchcut by John Handy, which are the basis for the fonts that bear the name Baskerville today. The excellent quality of his printing influenced such famous printers as Didot in France and Bodoni in Italy. Though he was known internationally as an innovator of technique and style, his high standards for paper and ink quality made it difficult for him to compete with local commercial printers. However, his fellow Englishmen imitated his types, and in 1768, Isaac Moore punchcut a version of Baskerville's letterforms for the Fry Foundry. Baskerville produced a masterpiece folio Bible for Cambridge University, and today, his types are considered to be fine representations of eighteenth century rationalism and neoclassicism. Legible and eminently dignified, Baskerville makes an excellent text typeface; and its sharp, high-contrast forms make it suitable for elegant advertising pieces as well.</p>

						<p><strong>Get back in the game.</strong> Within every man is the heart of an athlete. Rediscover yours.</p>
						<p>At some point, many a fortysomething guy has come to the same delusion: His glory days in athletics are behind him. "It's the greatest falsehoo of aging," says Mark Verstegen, president of Athletes' Performance, in Tempe Arizona. "At the age of 40, much of a man's athletic potential has simply been locked down by the sacrifices he has made to climb the ladder of success." The key to turning back the clock is to focus on excercises that build not only strength and power, but also muscular symmetry, coordination, and stability.</p>

          				<h3>Modular relationships</h3>
						<p>A <i>module</i> is a basic elementary unit that can be combined and repeated to become the basis for the whole. The physical world with its molecular and crystal structure, all life with its cellular structure, and much art and design are based on modular relationships. The most frequent use of modular structure in a graphic design is the use of a modular grid of horizontal and vertical linear divisions. A grid structure can take many forms: a regular sequence of squares or rectangels; a format of columns for publication design; and complex modular relationships that allow for diverse typographic treatments and a lage variety of image sizes and shapes.</p>
						<p>A <i>visual program</i> is a system of parameters used consistently to unify a series or sequence of designs. Grid structure, consistent use of type sizes and styles, placment of page numbers, and a color plan are factors that might beincluded. Russion constructivist designers of the 1920s made important contributions to the development of visual programs. The trilingual 1925 book, <i>The Ism of Art</i>, designed by El Lissitzky is a milestone in the use of a modular grid structure and mathematical measurement to bring order to complex visual material. Lissitzky carefully planned a visual program that gives order and consistent graphic properties. The book is organized into two sections: an eleven-page typographic section, followed by a fort-eight page pictorial portfolio presenting major European art movements from 1914 until 1924.</p>
						<p>Lissitzky executed his layouts on graph paper, which imposed the order of modular structure into his work. He specified san serif type, for he and other members of the mondern movement believe that it best expressed the rationalism of the scientific and technological era. Pictorial portfolio pages are anchored by heavy black rules in their top outside corners, adjacent to the name of the movement. Page numbers align with the outside vertical grid line. Visual continuity and immediate identification results, for readers quickly learn to look at the outside top corner for this information. By stripping away their backgrounds to silhoutte many of the photographs, Lissitzky gives them a strong "object quality." Picture numbers are large, which makes them concrete from in the design orginization. These numbers are composed in counterpoint to the illustrations. Lissitzky makes generous use of white space as an important compositional element.</p>

          				<h3>The illustrative grid</h3>
						<p>Another approach to the use of grids involves grid imagery as non-functional subject matter. The grid becomes an illustrative element rather than a functional skeleton. The grid becomes visible and conveys structure on itself. A stong association with planning, building, technology, architecture, and science is often implied.</p>
						<p>Postion of the grid is determined through a sense of pictorial space. Structure is incidental. Elements are placed inuitively.</p>

          				<h3>Interrupted grid</h3>
						<p>An effective technique for adding variety to grid layout and composition is to interrupt the grid. Interruption may be quite subtle or very dramatic. Use interruption for emphasis or to focus attention on a specific part of the layout.</p>
						<p>This technique is most effective when repetitive elements are necessary. interruption can happen with photos, text type, headlines, or color blocks.</p>

						<p>Angled grids offer relief from the familiar orientation of information.</p>
						<p>Inclined grids can push some units off the page that can be disregarded or used to bleed select photos.</p>
						<p>Keep the angle of inclination consistent. Information reading on an upward tilt is percieved more positively than tilting downward. The inclined grid is more effective for simple posters, flyers, and brochures than longer annual reports, magazines, or books. Inclined layouts have dynamic potential. Spaces tend to be unequal in volume. Incline helps exaggerate asymmetry.</p>

						<p>Lines with a length of 10-12 words are the most readable. Shorter lines are also effective. Extremely long lines decrease readability.</p>
						<p>Decide column length from margin requirements. It should be an exact number of lines. Cap height of the first line will determine the top of the column. Base line of the last line will determine the bottom of the column. Type density (greyness) relates to typeface and degree of linespacing.</p>
						<p>Experiment with margins to alter the look of grid layouts. margins are arbitrary. Unequal margins offer great design potential as do unusually wide margins. Bleed the grid or butt it to an edge for impact.</p>

          				<h3>Using grids</h3>
						<p>It is important to understand that even the well conceived grid, accurately drafted, will not insure effective design. The gird can only provide logical positions for placing visual material, nothing more. Designers must use the grid creatively to maximize communications potential. "Where should I put it?" is a questions that grids can help answer.</p>

          				<h3>Grid size</h3>
						<p>A strong reason for using a grid is to provide perceptual organization for an audience. When choosing the of number grid units beware of too many or too few. Designers can not communicate effectively above or below the perceptual limits of the audience. Viewers must be able to decipher a grid and sense its coherence to be comfortable. two or three grids per panel are too few modules. 72 or 124 are too many, as the audience has great difficulty sorting out the organization. The more grid modules and intersections, the more the layout positions exist for the designer. However, small grid units are difficult to construct, impede decision making and are not comfortable to the audience. The goal then is to adjust content to the number of grid units within a zone of perceptual acuity. Challenge the audience visually, but don't completely remove the the clues to the grid.</p>

          				<h3>Asymmetric composition</h3>
						<p>Designers often need to organize information in situations where there is not a logical opportunity for a symmetrical composition. Symmetry is a situation where, (as in human physiology) elements are balanced based on a center line. The composition of one side is identical (but reversed) to another. While this a is a good system, all situations do not lend themselves to a symmetrical order. Asymmetry is a balanced ordering of elements where one side of the composition does not mirror the other. An additional advantage of asymmetric compositions is that they have a tendency to be more dynamic that symmetric compositions.</p>
						<p>Dynamic compositions refers to a situation where the visual elements imply motion. The term dynamic is in contrast to the term staticm as situation where the elements appear ina fixed position.</p>

						<p>Designers often face the problem of organizing diverse visual elements on a plane. It is necessary to determine a rational structural system toward this end. One standard system used by designers is the grid. The grid provides an objective armature for organizing a visual composition.</p>
