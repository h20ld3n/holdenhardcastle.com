          				<h3>Color structure valuation is taught through the color wheel.</h3>
						<p> The primary colors, yellow, red, blue, and secondary colors, orange, green, violet, are invariably included in such a chart. But it usually also includes expanded mixtures of at least twelve hues. From this simple chart of a color wheel, multiple variations of color hues can be developed, which may or may not suggest to each other under certain circumstances. The judgement of the eye is usually checked on by the hand by actual touching. Is it really smooth, or does it just look that way? Is that an indentation or a raised mark? No wonder there are so many "DO NOT TOUCH!" signs. </p>

          				<h3>Texture has reference to the composition of a substance through minute variations on the surface material.</h3>
						<p>Texture should serve as a sensitive and enriching experience. Unfortunately, those "DO NOT TOUCH! signs in the expensive shops overlap into social behavior, and we are strongly conditioned not to touch things or people with anything approximating sensual involvement. The result is a minimal tactile experience and even a fear of tactile contact; the sense of blind touch is carefully guarded in sighted people. We act super-cautiously when blindfolded or in the dark, reaching out tentatively, and, because of our limited experience of touch, we often do not recognize a texture. At the 1967 Montreal Expo, the 5+ Coming Pavilion was designed for visitors to explore the quality of their five senses. It was a popular and enjoyable exhibit. People sniffed away at a series of funnels offering a variety of odors, even though they suspected, and justifiably, that some would be unpleasant. They listened, they looked, they tasted, but they stood hesitant and inhibited in front of the yawning holes designed to be reached inro blindly. What did they fear? it appears that the natural, free, "hands-on" investigative approach of the baby and young child has been conditioned out of the adult by—Who knows what?—the Anglo-Saxon ethic, Puritan repression, instinctive taboos. Whatever the reason, the result starves one of our richest senses. But in this increasingly simulated and plastic world, the problem arises infrequently. Most of our textural experience is optical, not tactile. Not only is texture faked rather convincingly in plastics and printed material and faked fur, but, also, much of what we see that is painted, photographed, and filmed convincingly presents texture that is not there. If we ouch a photograph of silky velvet, we do not have the convincing tactile experience the visual clues promise. Meaning is based on what we see. This fakery is an important factor in survival in nature; animals, birds, reptiles, insects, fish, take on the coloration and texture of their surroundings as a protection against predators. Man copies this camouflage method in war in response to the same needs for survival that inspires it in nature.  </p>

          				<h3>All visual elements have the capacity to modify and define each other.</h3>
						<p>The process, itself, is the element of scale. Color is bright or subdued depending on juxtposition, just as relative tonal values take on enormous visual modifications depending on what tone is next to or behind them. In other words, there can be no large without small. But even when large is established through small, the entire scale can be changed with the addition of another visual modification. Scale can be established not only through relative size of visual clues, but also through relationships to the field or the environment. The visual resuls in terms of scale are fluid and not absolute, since they are subject to so many variables of modification. All that is being observed is true in the context of scale. </p>

          				<h3>Scale is often used in plans and maps to represent real measurement in proportion.</h3>
						<p>The scale is usually designated, for example, 1 inch = 100 miles, or 1 inch = 10 miles. The globe of the world represents an enormous distance in small measurements. All of which requires some extension of understanding to visualize in terms of real distance measurement as it is simulated in a map or plan. Measurement is an integral part of a scale, but it is not crucial. What is more important is juxtaposition, what is alongside the visual subject, what setting it is in; these factors are more important.  </p>

          				<h3>The most vital factor in the establishment of scale is the measurement of man himself.</h3>
						<p>In matters of design that relate to comfort and fit, all manufacture is geared to the average size of human proportion. There is an ideal proportion, a mean average, and all the endless variations that make us all unique. Mass production is, of course, rules by the mean average with all large objects of manufacture, such as cars and bathtubs, adapted to that measure. On the other hand, clothes have multiple sizes in mass production, recognizing the enormous variations in individual human size. </p>

          				<h3>There are proportional formulas on which scale can be based;</h3>
						<p>The most famous is the Greek "Golden Mean." This is a mathematical formula of great visual elegance. it is arrived at by bisecting a square and using the diagonal of one half of the square as a radius to extend the dimensions of the square to become a "Golden Rectangle." In the proportion arrived at, a:b=c:a. The "Golden Mean" was used by the Greeks to design most of what they built from the classic Greek amphora to the floor plans of the temples and their elevations.</p>

          				<h3>There are many other scale systems;</h3>
						<p>The most outstanding contemporary version was developed by the late French architect, Le Corbusier. His modular unit, on which his entire system is based, is the size of man, and on this proportion, he establishes an average ceiling height, door size, window opening, et cetera. Everything becomes unitized and repeatable. Oddly enough, the unitized system of mass production has these effects built into it, and creative design solutions are often limited by what is available to design with, a limiting factor. </p>

          				<h3>Representation of dimension in two-dimensional visual formats is also dependent on illusion.</h3>
						<p>Dimension exists in the real world. We cannot only feel it, but with the aid of our two-eyed stereopticon sight, we can see it. But in all two-dimensional representations of reality in drawing, painting, photography, film, television, there is no actualized dimension; it is only implied. The illusion is reinforced in many ways, but the prime device for simulating dimension is the technical convention of perspective. The effects produced by perspective can be reinforced by tonal manipulation through "chiaroscuro," the dramatic emphasis of light and shade. </p>

						<p>That is, what it can see and record is determined by the focal length of its lens. But it cannot match the eye without enormous distortion of a fish-eye lens. The normal lens (3.43) has nowhere near the range of field of the eye, but what it does see is close to the perspective of the eye. The telephoto lens (3.42) can record visual information in ways the eye cannot, collapsing space like an accordion. The wide-angle lens broadens the scope of the field, but covers nowhere near the area of the eyes (3.44) Even though we may observe of the camera that it has its own perspective different from the human eye, one thing is certain; the camera can replicate the environment with startling accuracy and in infinite detail.</p>
