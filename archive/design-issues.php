          				<h3>Perception and visual communication</h3>
						<p>Meaning in visual message-making lies not only in the cumulative effects of the arrangement of the basic elements but also in the perceptual mechanism that is universally shared by the human organism. More simply put; we create a design out many colors and shapes and textures and tones and relative proportions; we relate these elements interactively; we intend meaning. The result is the composition, the artist's or photographer or designer's intention. It is their input. eeing is another and separate step in visual communication. It is the process of absorbing information int the nervous system through the eyes, the sense of sight. This process and capacity are shared by all people on a more or less common basis, finding its significance in terms of shared meaning. The two separate steps, seeing and designing and/or making are interdependent for both meaning in a general sense and message in the case of attempting to respond to specific communication. Between the general meaning, mood, or ambiance of visual information and a specific, defined message lies yet another area of visual meaning, functionality, in the objects that are designed, made and manufactured to serve a purpose. While it would seem that the message of such works is secondary to their visibility, the facts prove otherwise. Clothes, houses, public buildings, even the whittling and scrimshaw of amateur craftsman tell us an enormous amount about the people who design and chose them. And our understanding of a culture depends on our study of the world they built and the tools and artifacts and art they created. </p>
