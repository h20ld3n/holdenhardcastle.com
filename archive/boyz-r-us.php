							<li class="dialogue">People said I'd end up in jail. Guess it just took longer than expected. I can't blame 'em. I was always into trouble. Pigs hassling me, judges threatening to lock me up. I should have listened. I wouldn't be eating lumpy food and showering with every murder who's been on the news. You've got no idea. it's not like the tele. It's a tomb. You're not living at all. Everything's grey, floors, walls, meals...hope. You go crazy , the same god damn color staring at you everyday. Windows keep you sane. Waking up to see the blue skies and the white clouds, it's a depressing happiness. But no one cares. That's not what people are interested in. That's not what you're interested in. You want to know why, why, why I'm here? Well, everyone's got a story. I suppose mine's as good as any...to protect you from people like me. Once your inside, in it, in it for real...it's over. </li>
